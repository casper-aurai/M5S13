# [ARCH/MCP] Fetch MCP Server Implementation

## Component name
mcp-fetch-server

## Description
Build a secure HTTP client MCP server for health checks and smoke testing internal services. This server enables AI agents to perform HTTP requests to localhost/internal services only, with strict whitelisting and timeout controls to prevent external access or resource exhaustion.

## Sub-tasks
- [ ] Design HTTP operation interface (`http_get`, `http_post`, `http_health`)
- [ ] Implement URL whitelisting and validation
- [ ] Create request timeout and size limits
- [ ] Add response caching for health checks
- [ ] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Add SSL/TLS validation for HTTPS endpoints
- [ ] Create stdio and WebSocket transport support
- [ ] Write security tests and operational docs

## Priority
High

## Ready checklist
- [ ] exists ADR for this
- [ ] dependencies (httpx, URL validation) are in place
- [ ] health & metrics endpoints defined
- [ ] TODO: Add this to cascade rules store
