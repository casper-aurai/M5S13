# [ARCH/MCP] Filesystem MCP Server Implementation

## Component name
mcp-filesystem-server

## Description
Implement a secure filesystem MCP server that provides controlled file operations within workspace boundaries. This server enables AI agents to read, write, and manage files while enforcing strict sandboxing to prevent access outside the designated workspace root.

## Sub-tasks
- [ ] Design file operation interface (`fs_read`, `fs_write`, `fs_list`, `fs_search`)
- [ ] Implement path validation and sandboxing logic
- [ ] Create stdio and WebSocket transport layers
- [ ] Add file type detection and size limits
- [ ] Implement search functionality with glob patterns
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- [ ] Create unit and integration tests
- [ ] Write configuration and deployment documentation

## Priority
High

## Ready checklist
- [ ] exists ADR for this
- [ ] dependencies (Python asyncio, JSON-RPC) are in place
- [ ] health & metrics endpoints defined
- [ ] TODO: Add this to cascade rules store
