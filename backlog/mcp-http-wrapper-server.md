# [ARCH/MCP] HTTP-MCP Wrapper Server Implementation

## Component name
mcp-http-wrapper-server

## Description
Build a wrapper MCP server that enables safe calling of local HTTP endpoints and APIs. This server acts as a proxy between AI agents and internal HTTP services, providing pattern-based whitelisting, request/response filtering, and secure endpoint access controls.

## Sub-tasks
- [ ] Design HTTP wrapper interface (`http_get`, `endpoint_call`, `service_health`)
- [ ] Implement URL pattern matching and whitelisting
- [ ] Create request/response filtering and validation
- [ ] Add authentication and authorization handling
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and timeout controls
- [ ] Add request/response logging and monitoring
- [ ] Create WebSocket transport for real-time updates
- [ ] Write security tests and operational documentation

## Priority
Low

## Ready checklist
- [ ] exists ADR for this
- [ ] dependencies (HTTP client, pattern matching) are in place
- [ ] health & metrics endpoints defined
- [ ] TODO: Add this to cascade rules store
