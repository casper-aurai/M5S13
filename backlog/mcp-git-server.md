# [ARCH/MCP] Git MCP Server Implementation

## Component name
mcp-git-server

## Description
Build a Git operations MCP server that provides comprehensive repository management capabilities. This server enables AI agents to perform git operations like status checks, commits, branching, and diff analysis while maintaining repository integrity and security boundaries.

## Sub-tasks
- [x] Design git operation interface (`git_status`, `git_diff`, `git_commit`, `git_add`, `git_branch`, `git_log`, `git_checkout`, `git_remote`)
- [x] Implement repository boundary validation
- [x] Create safe git command execution layer
- [x] Add branch management and merging capabilities
- [x] Implement commit message validation
- [x] Add diff analysis and patch generation
- [x] Create stdio and WebSocket transport support
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests and documentation

## Implementation Status
✅ **Core Implementation Complete** - All git operations implemented with proper error handling and security boundaries
✅ **Transport Support** - Both stdio and WebSocket transports available
✅ **Dependencies** - GitPython and subprocess management in requirements.txt

## Remaining Work
- [ ] Create ADR documenting the Git MCP Server architecture
- [ ] Add /health and /metrics endpoints to base MCP server
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for all git operations
- [ ] Add documentation and usage examples
- [ ] Add git server to cascade rules store for project consistency

## Priority
High

## Ready checklist
- [ ] exists ADR for this
- [x] dependencies (GitPython, subprocess management) are in place
- [ ] health & metrics endpoints defined
- [ ] TODO: Add this to cascade rules store
