# ADR 0002: Use Airflow for Workflow Orchestration

## Status
Accepted

## Context
FreshPOC requires workflow orchestration to manage complex data processing pipelines involving:
- Data ingestion from multiple sources
- Data mining and pattern extraction
- Analysis and transformation
- Vector embedding generation
- Data storage and indexing
- Report generation and distribution

The platform needs a workflow orchestrator that can:
1. Handle complex dependencies between processing steps
2. Provide retry logic and error handling
3. Support both batch and streaming workflows
4. Integrate with existing data infrastructure (Kafka, databases)
5. Provide monitoring and alerting capabilities
6. Scale horizontally as the platform grows
7. Support both development and production environments

## Decision
We will use **Apache Airflow** as our primary workflow orchestration platform for the following reasons:

### Airflow Advantages
1. **Rich Python API**: Native Python support allows complex logic and easy integration
2. **DAG Visualization**: Built-in web UI for pipeline monitoring and debugging
3. **Extensive Operators**: Pre-built operators for common tasks (database, HTTP, messaging, etc.)
4. **Scalability**: Can scale from single-node to distributed deployments
5. **Active Community**: Large ecosystem of plugins and integrations
6. **Production Ready**: Battle-tested in enterprise environments
7. **Monitoring Integration**: Built-in metrics and logging capabilities

### Airflow vs Alternatives Considered
- **Prefect**: Modern Python-native workflows, but less mature than Airflow
- **Luigi**: Python-based, but limited web UI and ecosystem
- **Argo Workflows**: Kubernetes-native, but requires Kubernetes cluster
- **Temporal**: Java/Go-based, steeper learning curve for Python developers
- **Custom Scripts**: Too basic for complex dependencies and monitoring needs

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Developer Productivity**: Python-native development with rich debugging capabilities
- **Operational Visibility**: Excellent web UI for monitoring pipeline health and performance
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Wide range of pre-built operators for common integrations
- **Scalability**: Can grow with the platform from development to production
- **Community Support**: Large community and extensive documentation

### Negative
- **Resource Overhead**: Requires dedicated Airflow infrastructure (scheduler, webserver, workers)
- **Learning Curve**: DAG development patterns require some learning
- **Database Dependency**: Requires PostgreSQL for metadata storage
- **Configuration Complexity**: Multiple components to configure and maintain

### Architecture Decision
- **Single Airflow Instance**: Start with single-node deployment for Sprint 1
- **PostgreSQL Backend**: Use PostgreSQL for DAG metadata and state management
- **LocalExecutor**: Use local executor for initial development phase
- **DAG Organization**: Organize DAGs by business domain (e2e, data-quality, reporting, etc.)

## Implementation Plan

### Infrastructure Setup
- Deploy Airflow with PostgreSQL metadata database
- Configure proper networking and service discovery
- Set up health checks and monitoring integration
- Create initial DAGs for core workflows

### Development Workflow
- **DAG Development**: Develop DAGs in Python with proper error handling
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests for DAG logic
- **Code Review**: Review DAGs for best practices and performance
- **Version Control**: Store DAGs in Git with proper branching strategy

### Operations
- **Monitoring**: Integrate with Prometheus/Grafana for metrics
- **Logging**: Configure structured logging for troubleshooting
- **Alerting**: Set up alerts for DAG failures and performance issues
- **Backup**: Implement backup strategy for DAG metadata

### Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1 (Sprint 1)**: Set up basic Airflow infrastructure and initial DAG
2. **Phase 2 (Sprint 2)**: Implement core data processing workflows
3. **Phase 3 (Sprint 3+)**: Add advanced features (sub-DAGs, custom operators, etc.)
