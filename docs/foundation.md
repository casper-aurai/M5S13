### User

“Hello?”

### Assistant

Hey there! Feel free to let me know what you need and I'm here to help.

### User

“want to do a brainstorming session with you about a project that I'm working on and I'm almost finished.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, we can

### User

“I want to basically make a checklist and a to-do list on what still needs to happen, and on how we can test and validate certain things.”

### Assistant

Sure thing! We can definitely break it down into a nice clear checklist. Just let me know what the key parts of the project are and what's left on your mind. We'll line up a to-do list and figure out a good way to test each piece as we go.

### User

“Okay, the main components are, one, the infrastructure, two, the ingestion, three, the miners.”

### Assistant

Got it! So we

### User

“for the analyzers, and both the miners and the analyzers have plugins. Then the next big component is the query service, and the next component the graph writer, and lastly the reporting service, and one more, the monitoring service.”

### Assistant

Perfect, that gives us a nice big-picture map. So we’ll have a checklist that covers each of those major areas: infrastructure, ingestion, the miners and their plugins, the analyzers and their plugins, the query service, the graph writer, the reporting layer, and the monitoring piece.

From there, we’ll just note down what still needs finalizing in each area and how we can test or validate that it’s working as expected. Let’s dive into that step-by-step!

### User

“Use your expertise as a solution architect and designer of data pipelines to ask me specific questions about each of the different stages. And let's skip the infrastructure for now, because I just stabilized it this morning. And let's focus on the main services that actually realize the data flow from end to end.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, we can zero in on the main services that drive the data flow. So let's leave the infrastructure aside since you’ve got that locked in. I’ll start by asking a few targeted questions about each of those end-to-end services.

So first up, when we think about ingestion, can you tell me if there are any data sources or input formats that you’re still finalizing or that you need to validate? And then we can move on to the miners and analyzers next.

### User

“Okay, so the main data sources that we're ingesting are code repositories. We have one Hello World GitHub repository, mainly used just for testing. And then we have three private GitLab repositories, which are also being ingested, and of course, which are much more complicated. And with regards to file types, of course, code repositories can have all kinds of file types. So the miners and the analyzers are designed to basically handle different file types and also some, let's say, more meta topics, such as the Git history, the file systems, and other metadata.”

### Assistant

All right, that’s a pretty clear picture. So it sounds like your ingestion step is mostly about pulling in multiple code repositories from different sources—some on GitHub, some on GitLab—plus handling a mix of file types and also capturing things like Git history and other metadata.

So to get that into a checklist: first, we’ll want to confirm that each of those repositories is fully reachable and that authentication and access are stable. Then we’ll want to validate that the ingestion is correctly pulling in not just the code files but also the metadata like commit histories and directory structures.

Once we know all of that is solid, we’ll move on to how the miners and analyzers process those different file types and those extra pieces of metadata.

So my next question for you would be: are there any particular file types or metadata fields that you think might be tricky or that you want to double-check in terms of the miners and analyzers doing their jobs correctly?

### User

“Well, the primary focus is on, I think, SQL and Python, because the repositories we're ingesting is, one is a Databricks pipeline repository with DBT. The other one is the Pulumi repository that provisions the stack in Azure on which the Databricks pipeline run. And the third one is also more Pulumi-related”

### Assistant

All right, that makes

### User

“But yeah, that's our main focus. I think the bit more challenging ones might be Git, because it doesn't follow the same patterns as the other ones. For example, for Python, I have the AST libraries. For SQL, things like SQL glots, that of course do quite a bit of the heavy lifting. But of course, in the Git, there's very valuable information, for example, about the churn of code, hotspots, and those kinds of things.”

### Assistant

Got it, that makes a lot of sense. So it sounds like on the Python and SQL side, you're feeling pretty comfortable because you’ve got tools like AST libraries for Python and something like SQLGlot for SQL. Those handle a lot of the parsing and heavy lifting, so the miners and analyzers can just lean on those to do their job.

Now, with Git, you're right—it's a different beast because you're looking at code churn, hotspots, and all that historical context that comes out of the version control system. So one of our to-dos will be to make sure that we have a reliable way to mine that Git metadata—maybe using something like a Git log parser or a tool that can give us insights into where the most active changes are happening and which files are seeing the most churn.

So in short, we’ll add a checklist item to validate that the Python and SQL files are parsed correctly using those libraries, and then we’ll put a little extra focus on making sure that the Git mining piece is capturing all the historical and churn data that you need. And then we can move on to the next piece once we’ve got that covered.

### User

“Yeah, and I think another important part, but that basically goes for each stage, is how the data that's basically being extracted or being generated is being stored. We're using a memgraph graph database, and the idea is that, yeah, basically all the various stages, the different components, different miners, different analyzers, they all write their data to that memgraph database, and by basically following proper procedures and schemas for the graph structure, these things can also run asynchronously and parallel without causing issues, which you would have normally in a relational database.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, that’s a

### User

“So yeah, basically, and for the ingestion stage, it's also important that the files themselves are also stored in the Dockerfile system and that they are accessible for the different stages. So basically, after ingestion, it becomes more of a read-only, at least for repositories. But it is important that some files are also created. So we have some JSON state files, which will help us with the analysis in the monitoring stack. There is also Prometheus and Grafana, but we'll get to that later.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. So we’ll also want to add to our checklist that once ingestion pulls the repositories in, we confirm those files are in a stable read-only state in the Docker file system. That way each subsequent stage, whether it’s the miners, the analyzers, or any other component, can reliably read from those files without having to worry about changes happening underneath them.

And definitely, having those JSON state files will be a great way to track what’s been processed, and we can also make sure that each stage writes its results to Memgraph using the proper graph schema. That’ll let everything run asynchronously and in parallel, like you mentioned, without stepping on each other’s toes the way a relational database might.

So we’ll put that on our to-do list: ensure ingestion files are accessible and read-only, confirm state files are created as needed, and validate that each component writes cleanly into the Memgraph database. Then we can circle back to the monitoring stack a bit later.

### User

“Yeah, and I think also the feedback mechanisms are important. So if the graph writer receives requests to store things in the graph, then of course also the handling of edge cases is robust. And yeah, basically that it's resilient and it's hardened. So maybe in case of a connection loss or something like that, that there's a proper queue, we're using Redis also to help us manage that a bit.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, building in that resilience is a great idea. So we’ll add to the checklist that we need to confirm the graph writer has a robust fallback mechanism. That way, if it can’t reach Memgraph immediately—like if there’s a connection blip—it can queue those writes in Redis and then replay them once the connection is back. That’ll keep everything resilient and make sure you don’t lose any data if there's a temporary hiccup.

We’ll also want to verify that all those edge cases are handled gracefully. So if the graph writer sees some unexpected input or hits a schema mismatch, it logs that clearly and maybe even pushes a note into your monitoring stack so you know there was an issue.

So in short, we’ll add that to our to-do list: make sure the graph writer can handle disconnects gracefully with Redis as a buffer, confirm that it logs any edge case issues, and make sure the whole pipeline is resilient end to end. After that, we’ll be in a great spot to move on to monitoring.

### User

“Another important thing for this stage is basically the schema or the ontology. Of course, certain parts will be, let's call it, pre-populated or hard-coded, because we already know a lot of things that we're expecting, for example, a repository, a commit author, those kinds of, let's call them, primary elements of our ontology. But ontology also needs to be flexible, because we simply don't know exactly what the miners and the analyzers will be producing. Of course, this can only be partially automated, so there must be some human-in-the-loop construction, so we can extend the ontology.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, that makes

### User

“So let's say, for example, I approve another element to the ontology, it can also look back and reprocess things, so yeah, basically we don't need to go through the same loops the whole time. And that, for example, also goes for the ingestion of the repositories, I mean, if there were no changes since the last time we pulled it, we don't want to overburden the APIs by then pulling in the same data again.”

### Assistant

Exactly, that’s a really smart approach. So we’ll add to our checklist that the ontology should be both partly pre-defined for the known elements like authors and repos, but also flexible enough to let you approve new elements. Once you do that, you can have a sort of human-in-the-loop step where, after you’ve extended the ontology, the system can reprocess or backfill to include those new elements without redoing all the previous work manually.

And you’re absolutely right about avoiding redundant API calls during ingestion. We’ll just add a step to check if the repositories have changed since the last pull, and if not, we skip that re-fetch. That’ll keep things efficient and lighten the load on your data sources.

So all in all, we’ve got a good plan: flexible ontology, human-in-the-loop approval for new elements, reprocessing only when needed, and making sure we’re not doing unnecessary re-ingestion. Then we can move on to the next piece when you’re ready.

### User

“Yeah, I think another important part is also the persistence of that ontology, for example. So that if we, let's say, remove all the containers and redeploy it, that that doesn't get lost. So that means that ontology also needs to be versioned, and we'll probably also need some management tools for that ontology.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, that's a great point. Persisting that ontology is going to be key so that if you tear down and redeploy containers, you don't lose all that customization. So we'll add to the to-do list that the ontology needs to be versioned and stored somewhere durable, whether that's in a separate database, a volume that isn't removed, or even a simple versioned file that you back up and reload.

And it makes total sense to have some management tools around it, so you can easily update or extend that ontology without having to manually edit files each time. That way it's a smoother process to evolve it over time.

So we’ll lock that in: version the ontology, store it in a persistent location, and have a simple toolset to manage it. Once that's in place, you'll have a really flexible and durable setup.

### User

“Another point of attention is the way that the miners and the analyzers and the plugins in both, basically how that whole mesh is working together, because of course there is some overlap. I mean, the miners are extracting information, but so are the analyzers at some points, and there might even also be analyzers that combine data or information from different miners or from different analyzers. So this whole miner-analyzer mesh needs to be clarified, and also needs to be well documented with clear examples of how they work together.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, that’s a really important piece of

### User

“when the data gets handed over from one to another, and also the intelligence of that system, so recognizing which miners to run for what, those kinds of things. And also, of course, analyzers need to analyze on file level. But of course, there could also be cases that we also want to check across multiple files, especially, for example, with SQL. So that you want to know, yeah, how a certain variable, what the lineage is through the bronze layer, through the silver layer, through the gold layer, those kinds of things.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, and that’s a great point. It sounds like we definitely need to clarify and document the whole interplay between miners and analyzers—almost like a mesh that spells out who hands off data to whom and when. We’ll want to make sure that’s well documented with some clear examples so it’s obvious when a miner’s output flows into an analyzer or when multiple analyzers combine data from different miners.

And you’re right that it’s not just about file-level analysis but also about understanding when you need that broader, cross-file view. For example, if you’re looking at SQL lineage across bronze, silver, and gold layers, you’ll want analyzers that know how to connect those dots across multiple files or even multiple stages of the pipeline.

So we’ll add to the checklist that we need to have a clear mesh documentation, showing how miners and analyzers coordinate, and that we build in some logic so the system can recognize which miners and analyzers to run and when. That way, you get both file-level and cross-file insights without any confusion.

### User

“Yeah, and I think one point for later for the monitoring stack is also that we gather data and information on basically how the miners and the analyzers are performing. So we can also dashboard that to basically get transparency on the cold chain, because that's something that is currently still missing.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, and that

### User

### Assistant

All right, so we've got a solid picture now. We’ll add a note that the monitoring stack should definitely include visibility into how the miners and analyzers are performing. That way, you can build a dashboard—maybe in Grafana or whatever tool you’re using—that gives you that full-chain transparency. That’ll let you see which components are running efficiently, spot any bottlenecks, and make sure the whole pipeline is running smoothly. So with all of that in mind, we’ve got a pretty comprehensive to-do list and a good roadmap. Whenever you're ready, we can move on to the next piece or dive deeper into any part of it!

### User

“Let's move on to the next piece. That will be the graph writer. With everything that I just told you, ask me some targeted questions. Also, use your knowledge, your experience with knowledge graph engineering and with tools like Memgraph and Cypher, and overall solution architecture and your knowledge of Docker, to ask me a series of questions, so you get a better and clearer understanding of where we currently stand, what the situation is, and what we still can accomplish in the next two days before the first go live.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, let’s dive into that. So focusing on the graph writer and using a bit of that knowledge graph engineering mindset, I’ll throw a few targeted questions your way.

First off, in terms of how the graph writer is currently structured, do you already have a predefined schema in Memgraph that it’s writing to, or are you still finalizing what those node and relationship types look like? That’ll help me understand if we need to refine the schema or if it’s already pretty locked in.

Second, when it comes to how the graph writer handles data from multiple analyzers and miners,

### User

“Let's first answer the first question, because I can't remember all of them if you list them all at once. For the schema, I think the same principles go as with the ontology. Yes, there will be some predefined elements, the ones that we already have, but the schema needs to also align with the ontology. They go hand in hand and must also be able to dynamically evolve to a certain degree.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. So basically, just like the ontology, your schema is going to be partly predefined with those core elements you already know about, and it’s going to need that flexibility to evolve in sync with the ontology as you approve new elements. That’s a great approach because it means the graph structure won’t be too rigid and can adapt as your data model grows.

All right, let’s move on to the next part then. When it comes to how the graph writer is actually receiving and merging data from different miners and analyzers, do you already have a flow in place for how that handoff happens? For example, is there a certain format or a certain staging area where the analyzers put their results before the graph writer picks them up? Or is that still something you’re ironing out?

### User

“That's still something we're wiring up. There are some things in place, of course, but we ran into some errors, so most things were now handed or just sent in JSON. But you make a really good point. We currently don't really have a staging layer between that, and we currently also don't have that many insights on what is actually being sent, how it's being processed, and I think this is also where the complexity of the project comes in, making that translation. But basically, the basic connection between the containers, those kind of things, that's all there, and they can send the information, the containers can talk to each other. But we haven't yet, well, in the past with simpler setups during the first proof of concepts, of course, we were able to do so, but now this complicated productionalized setting, we haven't yet been able to populate the graph with, well, in this case, we're expecting hundreds of nodes, thousands of edges, you name it. But yeah, that's where the data flow ends at this moment.”

### Assistant

Got it, that’s really helpful context. So it sounds like the underlying container connections are in place and everyone's speaking JSON to each other, which is a good starting point. But now it’s really about introducing a bit more structure so you have a clear staging layer or some kind of intermediate step that makes it easy to see what’s being handed over before it actually hits the graph writer. And that’ll give you the visibility to troubleshoot and make sure that once you start populating hundreds of nodes and thousands of edges, you know exactly what’s flowing in.

So we’ll just note that as part of our to-do: set up a lightweight staging layer or an intermediate step so you can easily inspect and validate the data before it goes into the graph. And that’ll help you move from that proof-of-concept stage into the more complex production environment without losing track of what’s going on. Let’s keep going from there!

### User

“Do you have any more questions?”

### Assistant

Absolutely! Just a couple more questions to round out the picture. Now that we know the schema and the staging layer are still evolving, another thing I’m curious about is how you’re currently managing deployment and updates for the graph writer itself. Are you using something like Docker Compose to spin it up alongside the other services, and do you have a process in place for rolling out changes when you tweak the code or the configuration? That’ll help me understand how easily we can iterate as we go.

### User

“Yes, the basic infrastructure is all there. So currently we're using Compose files. They will still need some tweaking. The hot loading of the code doesn't really work yet, or at least we haven't really tested it, because only this morning I stabilized the whole Compose deployment and I'm now able to basically bring down the stack and bring it back up again without issues. We had some conflicts and some confusion because during refactoring some things were implemented duplicate, ports were not consistent across Docker files and Compose files. We also have the beginning of, let's say, the automated testing and some automated validation. And in some older versions, we had some more complicated logic in that. But because the primary focus now was also on getting everything working end-to-end, I'm not 100% sure that all the automated tests are still in place. But indeed, we also have, let's say, the pre-commit hooks and things like that. So there's definitely a lot of logic on the shelf. But yeah, probably not everything is wired in yet. There might be some gaps in there that we still need to, or we could still address, but maybe they're more of a nice to have. But yeah, that's for later on, how we prioritize and categorize all the issues that still need to be done.”

### Assistant

Perfect, that gives a really clear picture. It sounds like you’ve got the fundamentals in place with the Compose setup, and you’re just now reaching that point where everything’s stable enough to bring the whole stack up and down without conflicts. And it makes sense that the hot reloads and some of the automated testing might not be fully wired up yet, especially since you’ve been focused on just getting that end-to-end flow working.

So we’ll just note that as a future step: maybe once you’ve got the core flow running, you can revisit those pre-commit hooks and automated tests to make sure they’re still relevant and that they’re helping you catch any issues early. But for now, it sounds like the main priority is just getting that first go-live done and then iterating from there. And of course, we can always revisit those nice-to-haves once the core pipeline is humming along.

So I think we’ve got a really good understanding now. If there’s anything else, just let me know, but I think we’ve got a solid roadmap to work with.

### User

“Okay, do you have any more targeted technical questions?”

### Assistant

I think we’ve covered most of the big technical angles for now! We’ve got a clear sense of how your schema and ontology need to remain flexible, how the graph writer will need a bit of a staging layer for visibility, and how your deployment is evolving with Compose and a few more automated checks down the line.

If any other questions pop up later or you need to dig into another piece, just let me know. For now, I think we’re in a good spot to proceed!

### User

“Okay, then let's proceed to the next module or stage or whatever we want to call it, which is also, by the way, a point from the checklist, standardizing of naming, clear separation of concerns, and focusing on the developer experience so that other developers, yeah, quite intuitively can find their way around the repository, and basically that they just need to focus more on the code level, on the logic level, what they want to put in the graph, what they want to get out, but they shouldn't worry much about the whole infrastructure deployment things. That must be good enough for them to focus on the real knowledge logic instead of messing around with Docker.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, and that's a great final note to add. Standardizing naming and making sure the developer experience is smooth is definitely a worthwhile goal. It means that once the infrastructure is stable, other developers can jump in, focus on the actual logic of what goes into the graph and what they want to query out, and not have to wrestle with deployment details.

So we’ll add that to the checklist as well: we’ll aim for clear naming, good separation of concerns, and a developer-friendly environment so that the team can focus on the actual knowledge graph logic rather than on Docker or Compose quirks.

All right, I think we’ve got a really solid foundation. Let’s move on to the next module and keep that momentum going!

### User

“Okay, the next module is the Query Service. This is basically an umbrella term for everything that's related to getting information out of the graph. And of course, that can be at various stages. So it might also be that miners or analyzers also want to check things in the graph. That could be to check if something is already there, or to retrieve examples, or to compare the results of an analysis step of one Python file with the average of all Python files, some cumulative things I can imagine. But the primary goal of the Query Service is also for, let's say, the second wave of our entire project, because the last stage is that the information from the graph gets queried. And then by using Jinja templates, we can generate markdown documents with information from this graph and easily be able to generate overview tables, reports, and very, very important, I think almost one of the key points is to generate diagrams from this knowledge graph. So for now, for this first version, we'll just start with Mermaid to keep the level of complexity down a bit. But of course, we want to extend this. We'll call it Reporting Service now, with other support for other file formats, more complicated things, all the way up to RGMate and everything in between.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, that all makes a lot of sense. So essentially, the query service is really the heart of how you pull meaningful insights out of the graph and not just for end-user reports, but also to help the miners and analyzers do things like compare results or check for existing nodes. And it’s great that you’re starting with Mermaid for diagram generation, because that’ll let you keep it simple and then expand to more complex formats like ArchiMate later on.

So let’s do the same thing we’ve been doing: I’ll ask you a couple of targeted questions just to refine what we need here. First, in terms of querying the graph, are you already settled on using Cypher or another query language for Memgraph? And do you have any specific queries or patterns you already know you need, or are we starting more from a blank slate on that?

### User

“We have some examples in place. Of course, this is also still evolving. At the moment, indeed, we're using Cypher and using the Neo4j library for the communication. But I also noticed that some of the coding agents sometimes get a bit confused and they use Neo4j-specific query styles or lexical things instead of the memgraph. And I also noticed that it also makes a difference which version of memgraph is being used. So what I think is still a bit missing is the insights or the data contracts or the schema generation that should be done automatically to, between different services, communicate more clearly what can actually be queried, what is available. And this kind of documentation, similar to the Swagger API documentation, we're using FAST API, by the way, is generated. This should also be versioned so we can also track over time, yeah, basically how the available functionality of our knowledge graph and the contracts between the services is evolving. So we can also later on in the long term make transparent what the value is that is being brought.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, that’s a really good insight.

### Assistant

So it sounds like you have the foundation with Cypher and the Neo4j library, but there’s still a bit of friction around making sure everything is consistent and that the agents or the code don’t get confused between Neo4j and Memgraph specifics. And definitely having something like versioned schema documentation or a kind of Swagger-like auto-generated contract would help everyone see exactly what’s available to query at any given time. So we can definitely add that to the roadmap—some form of automatically generated documentation for your graph queries, just like you have with FastAPI on the API side, so that anyone interacting with the graph knows what to expect. And that will also help show how the

### Assistant

So in short, we'll add that to the checklist for the query service stage: making sure we have a consistent, versioned way to document what’s in the graph and how to query it, so everyone stays on the same page. That'll also make it easier to extend to things like Jinja templates and diagrams. Let’s keep going from there!

### User

“Do you have any other questions about the query surface?”

### Assistant

I think we’ve covered the key points for now! We know you’re using Cypher with a Neo4j-style approach, and we’ve noted that we’ll want to create some versioned schema documentation to keep things clear. We also know you’re starting with Mermaid for diagrams and plan to expand that in the future. So for now, I think we have a good handle on the query service direction. If you have any more specifics later on, just let me know!

### User

“Okay, then let's move on to the reporting surface, so where the actual rendering and the creation of the markdown and the mermaid happens, and where the mermaid is also embedded in the markdowns. And not only, let's say, how the final product is generated, but this stage, we also want to keep the intermediate products. So, for example, for mermaids, it will be helpful to also have them stored somewhere as images, so we can easily iterate in improving stylistic things, maybe. We want centralized styling to be available, so that's not defined in every template. Yeah, those kinds of things, so I'm really curious to see what kind of questions you have for me about that.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, that makes sense. So this reporting service stage is really about taking all that graph data and turning it into polished Markdown documents and Mermaid diagrams and making sure that you have a nice, consistent style along the way. So let me ask a couple of targeted questions to help us refine that.

First, when it comes to embedding Mermaid diagrams into Markdown, do you already have a particular toolchain in mind for converting those diagrams into images, or are you thinking about keeping them as live Mermaid code blocks that get rendered on the fly? And second, for that centralized styling you mentioned, do you have a particular format or a particular templating approach in mind to manage those styles, or is that something we can figure out as we go? Let me know and we can refine from there.

### User

“It's definitely something we can figure out as we go. The mermaid diagrams definitely need to be code blocks, but basically there should be a side step or a branching of the process in which the other formats get generated. This does not only apply to the mermaid diagrams, but for example, so tables that are being generated or certain percentages. So if they are used in other places, in other reports, that we don't calculate things twice, as the process and the calculations are not that heavy. It doesn't need to be 100 percent. But of course, the mechanism should be there to prevent any silly repetition of the same task.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. So essentially, we want to keep those Mermaid diagrams as code blocks in the Markdown, but also have a step where we can branch off and generate them as images or other formats when needed. And the same goes for things like tables or calculations. We want to avoid recalculating them multiple times and just have a single source of truth that we can reuse across different outputs.

So we’ll add that to the plan: make sure we have a mechanism to render intermediate artifacts, like images or pre-calculated tables, and then reuse them wherever needed so we’re not repeating work. And we’ll also figure out a centralized styling approach as we go so that everything looks consistent.

That should give us a good starting point. Let’s keep going from here!

### User

“Okay, what other questions do you have for me about the reporting slash rendering service?”

### Assistant

Sure! Another thing I’m curious about is how you plan to handle versioning and storage of these generated artifacts. For example, once you produce a Markdown report or an image, do you envision storing them in a specific directory structure, pushing them to a repo, or maybe even having some automated pipeline that archives them? And related to that, do you have any thoughts on how to handle updates so that if the data changes, you can regenerate those reports and diagrams without losing track of previous versions? That’ll help us make sure everything is nicely organized and easy to maintain.

### User

“The output is definitely to be stored and versioned, so also business users can go to the repository and basically just need to go to one folder and they can just browse the generated documentation without having to go through the code, because eventually we also want this project to be triggered once there was a release in one of the repositories, for example, that in GitLab with runners, this gets triggered automatically. And that way, because the documentation is also versioned and because it's generated in a deterministic way, the amount of changes that we see in the documentation also says something about the changes that were made in the code. And hopefully that way, in the long term, get more grip and transparency on where all the different repositories from all the different teams are moving towards, because that's something, let's say, from a C-level management, we currently don't have that much insight in, and it's more based on feeling and dependent on the communication between the developers in the different teams.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, that makes a lot of sense. So basically, by versioning the output and making it easily accessible in a single folder, you’re letting business users just browse the generated documentation without having to dive into the code. And because you’re doing it in a deterministic way, each new release or each new version gives you a clear picture of what changed. That’s a great way to add transparency for the whole organization and help leadership see how things are evolving over time.

So we’ll definitely add that to the plan: we’ll have a versioned output directory that’s easy for non-technical users to navigate, and we’ll tie the documentation generation into your release process so it updates automatically. That way, everyone can see the evolution of both the code and the documentation side by side. Sounds like a solid plan!

### User

“The automated hooks for the trigger when something else in a repository changes is nice to have for in the future, but it's not a key requirement that needs to be done after these two days we still have left.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, that makes sense. We can treat those automated hooks as a nice future enhancement but not something that has to be done right now. For the next couple of days, we’ll just focus on getting the core reporting service working, making sure we can generate those documents and diagrams, and keep them nicely versioned and accessible. Then down the line, when you have more time, you can add those automated triggers to make everything run even more seamlessly. Sounds like a plan!

### User

“Any other questions on the reporting service itself?”

### Assistant

I think we’ve covered the essentials pretty well. We’ve got a plan for embedding diagrams, handling styling, versioning outputs, and making sure everything is clear and accessible. So unless there’s anything else specific on your mind, I think we’re in good shape to move forward from here!

### User

“Okay, then let's move to the monitoring service.”

### Assistant

All right, let’s dive into the monitoring side of things then! So the monitoring service is going to be all about making sure you have visibility into how everything is running—whether that’s performance metrics, error logging, or just general health checks. Let me ask you a couple of questions to get us started on that.

First off, do you have any specific tools in mind, like Prometheus and Grafana, that you want to use for monitoring, or are you open to suggestions? And second, are there particular metrics or logs you already know you want to capture—like resource usage, how long certain queries take, or counts of certain types of events? That’ll help us figure out exactly what to track so you get the insights you need.

### User

“Currently, we are using Grafana and Prometheus, but I'm definitely open for suggestions. The monitoring stack is not fully matured yet, so we still—and that basically goes overall for the project, also on other points—I mean, we have two days left. It's fine that we make some pivots at some point, so also please make a note that identifying potential pivot points is very important. Not necessarily that we need to do them now or to pivot, but knowing where we could pivot could help us with maturing the structure of the overall project.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, that makes a lot of sense. We can definitely keep an eye on identifying those pivot points so that as the project matures, you’ll know where you can change tools or adjust the structure if needed. For now, it sounds like Prometheus and Grafana are a good starting point, and we can build out the monitoring stack with those. And if we see an opportunity to pivot to something else or refine the approach, we’ll note that down.

As for the metrics, we can start by tracking things like resource usage, maybe how long different queries take, and any error counts or event logs that are helpful for debugging. That’ll give you a good baseline of visibility. And as we go, we can fine-tune which metrics are most valuable. So I think we’ve got a solid plan there!

### User

“I think the key point for the monitoring is also to gain insights into that end-to-end data flow and how well the handoffs between different layers and between different services is going, so we can identify any weak links in the mesh or underutilized things in the mesh, because one of the fears is, of course, that we, for example, make a very complex analyzer for, let me think of an example, something very DBT-specific, but the code is there, the analyzer is there, the analyzer is working, the analyzer is testing, but in practice it's then almost never used, yeah, so also think a bit along those lines in what we can also put on the checklist.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, that’s a really valuable angle. We definitely want the monitoring to give you a sense not just of performance, but also of how often each component is actually being used. That way, you can spot if you’ve got some elaborate analyzer that’s barely ever triggered in practice, and maybe that’s a candidate for simplification or rethinking. So we’ll put that on the checklist as well: we’ll make sure the monitoring includes some usage metrics for each service and each layer, so you can see which parts of the mesh are really active and which ones might be underutilized.

That’ll help you keep everything lean and efficient as you move forward. Great point, and we’ll definitely factor that in!

### User

“And another one that I want to get insights in is the relation between the actual input files and then the nodes and edges that get created. Of course, you can calculate this in various ways, but we need to get some insights into, okay, what is this repository now actually delivering, what are certain file types actually delivering, how well interconnected is the knowledge graph, are there differences between certain repositories in that sense. So we need some averages, some medians, some aggregations, some cumulative things, and also some time series. And all of this doesn't need to be fully implemented now or super complex, but we do need to get the fundamentals and some examples in there that are actually wired in correctly and that actually work so that during the demonstration in two days it's also more clear what the potential is and basically why C-level needs to invest more time and means into building this out.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, that’s a great goal. So we definitely want to have at least some fundamental metrics that show how the input files translate into the graph structure—things like how many nodes and edges are being created per file or per repository, and some basic aggregations like averages or medians so you can see which repositories are more interconnected and which file types are adding the most value.

And it’s totally fine to keep it simple for now. We just want a few working examples in place so that during your demo, you can show the leadership team, “Hey, here’s how we can track what each repository is contributing to the graph, and here’s why it’s valuable.” That'll help make the case for more investment going forward. So I think that’s a perfect addition to our checklist!

### User

“Do you have more questions for me?”

### Assistant

I think we’ve got a really solid handle on the monitoring service for now. We’ve covered the key metrics you want to track, the tools you’re starting with, and the idea of identifying future pivots as the project evolves. So I’d say we’re in great shape. If anything else comes up, just let me know, but I think we’re all set with this part!

### User

“Okay, then let's move on to the more overarching topics, such as Docker, coding standards, documentation standards, cleanup actions that still need to happen. Yeah, those kinds of things.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, let’s zoom out and talk about those overarching topics. So this is really about making sure that everything is standardized and tidy, from your Docker setup to your coding standards to the overall documentation. Let me ask a couple of questions to guide us.

First, for Docker and your coding standards, do you already have a preferred set of linting tools or formatting tools you like to use—like maybe something like Black for Python or a certain linter for your Dockerfiles? And second, on the documentation side, do you have a particular format or style guide you want to follow for the Markdown docs? Or is that something you’d like to establish so that everything is consistent as you go forward? Let me know and we’ll figure it out from there.

### User

“For Python, we have some linting and formatters, I think it was black and rough, that's currently being used. I think for testing it was PyTest, maybe also MyPy, but I'm not 100% sure. With regards to the documentation, the challenge is that during the development last week, we had different coding agents at various points in time. It basically generates really extensive documentation. But we've been refactoring, putting things in the bit, starting over quite a few times. So they're definitely not in sync. A lot of them are also in the wrong place or way too long. Not focused on the key audience, so in this case the developers and the business users.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. So we’ll keep using tools like Black and Ruff for Python formatting and linting, and pytest for testing—maybe with mypy if you decide to include type checking as well. That’ll give you a nice, consistent code style.

For the documentation side, it sounds like we just need to do a bit of cleanup and set some guidelines so that the docs are actually aligned with the current state of the code. We can make sure that they’re placed in the right folders, that they’re concise and relevant to either developers or business users, and that we have a clear style guide so everything looks consistent going forward.

In other words, we’ll just add a step to standardize and streamline the documentation so it’s easier to maintain and more focused on the right audience. And that’ll help keep everything nice and clean as you move forward.

### User

“Yeah, another important thing I think to note is that, indeed, we are using types, we're using Bidentic. In the past, we had some struggles with not the v2 version of Bidentic being consistent, used everywhere. And I think with regards to cleaning up, it's not just the documentation, it's also on the code level. So it's also, in general, the still codes, duplication, legacy references. One of the things we noticed that during the development phase, a lot of times there were experiments, and during the experiments, they integrated backwards compatibility, but the actual backwards compatibility never got removed afterwards.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, that’s a really good point. So we’ll definitely add to the checklist that part of the cleanup is not just about the docs, but also about the code itself. We’ll want to go through and remove any stale code, any leftover backward compatibility pieces that are no longer needed, and just any duplication that built up during those experiments. That way, you’re left with a clean, consistent codebase that uses the same version of Pydantic everywhere and doesn’t have any of that leftover clutter.

It’s a great idea to have that kind of cleanup step before you present everything, so it’s clear and easy to understand. We’ll make sure that’s on the list, and then you’ll be in great shape going forward.

### User

“Now use your experience as a lead engineer who does many, many code reviews to also populate the checklist for this part with, let's say, the more generic or more general checks we can do that are maybe not only project-specific, but maybe also some project-specific parts based on the information you've received so far.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, I’d be happy to help flesh that out. So let’s think about some general best practices that we can put on your checklist.

First, we’ll want to include a code review step that looks for consistent coding style and formatting. That means checking that Black and Ruff have been run, that type hints are consistent if you’re using mypy, and that Pydantic models are all on the same version. Basically just making sure there’s a uniform style across the codebase.

Second, for documentation, let’s put a general guideline in place that each module or major component has a short, focused docstring at the top explaining what it does. And we’ll standardize on a particular Markdown format for the user-facing docs, just to keep everything uniform.

Third, we’ll add a general cleanup task to review and remove any dead code, old compatibility layers, or unused dependencies. It’s a good idea to run a quick dependency check to make sure you’re only using what you need.

And finally, let’s add a checklist item to ensure that any experimental or legacy references are either removed or clearly marked, so there’s no confusion about what’s current and what’s not.

Those steps should give you a nice, clean, and consistent project that’s easy for anyone to jump into and understand. Let’s add those to the list and you’ll be all set!

### User

“Also add some more general things as going through the code, looking for comments that are still hinting for to-dos, or deprecated parts, or duplicate parts, and those kinds of things.”

### Assistant

Absolutely, that’s a great addition. We’ll definitely add a step to scan through the code for any leftover to-do comments, deprecated sections, or duplicate pieces that need to be cleaned up. It’s a good practice to make sure that all those little leftover notes are resolved so that no one gets confused about what still needs to be done or what’s out of date. We’ll add that to the checklist, and that should give you a nice final polish on the whole codebase.

### Assistant

To help you design a clear agile breakdown and GitHub issue strategy, could you clarify a few key points first:

1. What is the total team size and composition (e.g., architects, engineers, analysts)?
2. Do you have a fixed milestone you’re targeting for delivery (e.g., internal demo, stakeholder review)?
3. Are there any major components you consider finalized or frozen (like the ingestion layer or monitoring), so we can reduce noise in issue creation?
4. Is there a preferred tooling setup beyond GitHub—like GitHub Projects, Jira, Notion, etc.—that you'd like the plan to integrate with or export to?

Once I have that, I’ll generate three different proposals for your two-day agile breakdown, each with clear structure around epics, work packages, and high-priority issues.

### Assistant

Great — with 1 architect + 2 engineers, a 2-day window, and ingestion mostly done, here are three crisp ways to structure the work. Each proposal includes a sprint goal, milestone/epics, tightly scoped work packages (with owners, estimates, dependencies), guardrails, and demo criteria so we don’t drift.

# Proposal A — Vertical Slice First (E2E Value in 48h)

Sprint Goal (2 days)

Deliver a working end-to-end slice: mine+analyze two repos → populate Memgraph with ≥500 nodes / ≥2,000 edges → expose 3 Cypher queries via Query Service → generate 3 Markdown reports with embedded Mermaid → Grafana shows 6 pipeline KPIs.

---

Common Building Blocks (for all proposals)

Definition of Ready (per issue)

- Clear owner, AC, estimate, dependency noted
- “How to test” described (curl or make)
- Failure criteria known (what breaks the demo)

Definition of Done (per issue)

- Passing local tests + pre-commit
- Metrics/logs observable (if relevant)
- Docs: one paragraph in `docs/` or README section updated
- Demo note: 1–2 commands to show it works

Testing & Validation Checklist

- Writer: duplicate submit → no dupes in graph
- Backpressure: simulate Memgraph outage → Redis buffers → replay
- Query: 95p latency < 200ms on local; schema change doesn’t 500
- Reporting: deterministic outputs (golden file compare on CI)
- Monitoring: KPIs present and non-zero during run

GitHub Issue Hygiene

- Labels: `pri:P1|P2`, `area:*`, `type:feature|bug|chore`, `size:S|M|L`, `status:blocked`
- Titles start with area (e.g., `[writer] Idempotent upsert keys`)
- Link dependencies via “Blocks/Blocked by #id”
- Keep each issue ≤ 0.5 day effort; break down otherwise

Recommended “make” Targets

- `make e2e` — end-to-end run, produces reports
- `make seed` — apply ontology/schema migrations
- `make stage-scan` — validate staged payloads & print summary
- `make writer-replay` — drain DLQ
- `make demo` — runs the happy-path demo script

Which proposal do you want to adopt for the next 48 hours?

- A maximizes visible value end-to-end.
- B balances core delivery with long-term DX.
- C aggressively retires scale/reliability risks to keep future velocity high.

If you pick one, I’ll turn it into a ready-to-paste Markdown backlog (with issue titles, labels, AC, and estimates) you can drop into GitHub.

### Assistant

Here’s a focused, ready-to-paste backlog for a 48-hour “E2E Demo-Ready Slice” milestone. Each issue has crisp labels, estimates, dependency notes, and step-by-step agent instructions. Replace `@architect`, `@eng-a`, `@eng-b` as needed.

Milestone: M1 — E2E Demo-Ready Slice (48h)

Sprint Goal: Mine+analyze 2 repos → populate Memgraph (≥500 nodes / ≥2,000 edges) → expose 3 queries → generate 3 Markdown+Mermaid reports (+PNG side-cars) → Grafana shows 6 KPIs.

**Labels:** pri:P1, type:feature, area:staging, size:S

**Owner:** @architect

**Estimate:** 2h

**Depends on:** —

**Description**

Define the cross-service payload schema used by analyzers/miners → staging → graph-writer. Include Python, SQL, and Git event types and a minimal “meta” envelope with versioning and traceability.

**Agent Instructions**

1. Add `models/contract_v01.py` (Pydantic v2) with envelopes:
  - `Envelope{ contract_version:str, trace_id:str, event_ts:datetime, kind:Literal["python","sql","git"], payload:Union[PythonItem,SqlItem,GitItem] }`.
2. Export JSON Schema to `contracts/contract_v01.schema.json`.
3. Add 3 sample payloads to `contracts/examples/*.json`.
4. Document field semantics in `docs/contracts.md` (brief).

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Pydantic models compile (v2).
- Schema and 3 example files present.
- `contract_version == "0.1"`; trace_id required.
- `make contract-validate` succeeds on examples.

**How to test**

~~~ python
make contract-validate
python - <<'PY'
from models.contract_v01 import Envelope
import json, glob
for p in glob.glob("contracts/examples/*.json"):
 Envelope.model_validate_json(open(p).read())
print("OK")
PY

## 2) [staging] Write-Once Staging Layer (JSONL + Index)

**Labels:** pri:P1, type:feature, area:staging, size:M

**Owner:** @eng-a

**Estimate:** 3h

**Depends on:** #1

**Description**

Introduce a local “S3-like” staging folder for analyzers/miners to drop validated envelopes before graph-writer consumption.

**Agent Instructions**

1. Directory layout: `/staging/{repo}/{run_id}/{phase}.jsonl` (append-only).
2. On finalize, write `/staging/{repo}/{run_id}/index.json` with file list, byte sizes, SHA256.
3. FastAPI endpoint: `GET /staging/index?repo=&run_id=` returns the index.
4. Add `make stage-scan` to print counts per phase and basic integrity (sha/size).

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Append-only JSONL enforced.
- Index contains `files[], total_bytes, records_per_file`.
- Endpoint returns 200 with correct shape.
- `make stage-scan` prints summary (no exceptions).

**How to test**

~~~
make stage-scan
curl -s "http://localhost:800X/staging/index?repo=helloworld&run_id=local" | jq .

## 3) [writer] Deterministic Upsert Keys (MERGE) + Idempotency

**Labels:** pri:P1, type:feature, area:writer, size:M

**Owner:** @eng-b

**Estimate:** 5h

**Depends on:** #1, #2, #4

**Description**

Implement MERGE-based upserts with deterministic keys for nodes/edges so replays don’t create duplicates.

**Agent Instructions**

1. Define key strategy in `docs/graph-keys.md`:
  - Nodes: `:Repo{rid}`, `:File{rid}`, `:Symbol{rid}`, `:Commit{sha}`, etc. where `rid = sha1(repo|path|kind)`.
  - Edges: key via `(start_key, type, end_key, props_hash)`.
2. Implement Cypher builders `writer/cypher/upsert.py` that emit `MERGE` on keys + `SET` props.
3. Provide unit tests with synthetic payloads (run twice → same counts).

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Two consecutive writes of the same staged batch result in 0 additional nodes/edges.
- Keying strategy documented and referenced in code.
- Tests pass locally.

**How to test**

~~~ json
pytest -k test_idempotency -q
python scripts/load_synthetic.py && python scripts/load_synthetic.py
python scripts/graph_counts.py
~~~

## 4) [writer] Redis Buffer, Retry, and DLQ (Memgraph Outage Safe)

**Labels:** pri:P1, type:feature, area:writer, size:M

**Owner:** @eng-b

**Estimate:** 3h

**Depends on:** #3

**Description**

When Memgraph write fails, push envelope to Redis queue; exponential backoff retry; unrecoverable → DLQ stream.

**Agent Instructions**

1. Introduce `queues: writer.main`, `writer.dlq` (Redis list/stream).
2. Retry policy: 3 immediate retries (100/300/900ms), then enqueue; background worker drains when Memgraph healthy.
3. Add `scripts/writer_replay.py` to drain `writer.main`; `scripts/writer_dlq_dump.py` to inspect failures.
4. Emit Prom metrics (see issue #7).

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Killing Memgraph during write does not lose envelopes; are retried or end in DLQ.
- Replay drains backlog on Memgraph restore.

**How to test**

~~~ json
make writer-replay
docker stop fp-infra-memgraph && python scripts/send_100_envelopes.py && docker start fp-infra-memgraph
python scripts/writer_replay.py
python scripts/graph_counts.py
~~~

## 5) [ontology] Ontology v0.1 + Startup Migration

**Labels:** pri:P1, type:feature, area:ontology, size:S

**Owner:** @architect

**Estimate:** 2h

**Depends on:** —

**Description**

Versioned `ontology.yml` (semver) + a startup task that seeds core labels/rel types and constraints in Memgraph.

**Agent Instructions**

1. Create `ontology/ontology.yml` with nodes, rels, required properties, and indexes/constraints.
2. Generate `migrations/0001_seed.cypher` at build time.

### Assistant

Below is a clean, “to-be” replacement of your architecture report, aligned to the 48-hour E2E milestone and the decisions we just locked in (staging layer, contract v0.1, ontology versioning, idempotent writer with Redis buffer, saved queries, reporting with Markdown+Mermaid(+PNG), and minimal but meaningful KPIs). It is structured for direct commit as `platform.md` and deliberately trims “as-is” language. Where relevant, I’ve preserved section anchors from the old document so existing links don’t break, while explicitly marking material changes.

Reference note: this supersedes the prior “Comprehensive Architectural Design Report” layout in your repository. platform

## 1. Executive Summary

**Goal (48h):** End-to-end slice from two repos (1×GitHub, 1×GitLab) → Memgraph ≥ **500 nodes / 2,000 edges** → **3 saved queries** → **3 Markdown reports with Mermaid (+PNG)** → Grafana shows **6 KPIs** moving during the run.

**Core shifts from prior baseline**:

- Introduce **write-once staging layer** between analyzers/miners and writer.
- Enforce **Contract v0.1** (Pydantic v2 / JSON-Schema export) at handoff.
- **Graph Writer** uses deterministic MERGE keys (idempotent), **Redis buffer + DLQ** for outage safety.
- **Ontology v0.1** versioned; **startup migrations** seed constraints/indexes.
- **Query Service** provides **Saved Query Registry** (3 named queries).
- **Reporting** emits Markdown with `mermaid` blocks and **PNG side-cars**; deterministic “golden” outputs.
- **Monitoring** exposes minimal but high-signal KPIs and a single E2E dashboard.

This replaces the earlier “as-is” narrative with an executable “to-be” blueprint for go-live. platform

REP ->|uses P5| P5
P2 -. usage stats .-> MON
P4 -. KPIs .-> MON
STG -. KPIs .-> MON
REP -. timings .-> MON
```

### 2.2 Naming & Ports (stable)

- Services: `fp-{category}-{service}` (e.g., `fp-app-graph-writer`, `fp-infra-memgraph`, `fp-monitor-grafana`).
- App ports: **8003–8010**; Infra: **6379 (Redis), 7687/7444 (Memgraph)**; Monitor: **9090/3000**. platform

---

## 3. Service Architecture

### 3.1 Handoff Contract (v0.1)

- Envelope: `contract_version`, `trace_id`, `event_ts`, `kind ∈ {python, sql, git}`, `payload{…}`.
- **Pydantic v2** models generate authoritative **JSON-Schema**; examples stored under `contracts/examples/`.
- Validation occurs **on ingress to STG** and again **on writer consume** (rejects counted & logged).

### 3.2 Staging Layer (write-once)

- Layout: `/staging/{repo}/{run_id}/{phase}.jsonl` (append-only).
- Finalize by writing `/staging/{repo}/{run_id}/index.json` (file list, sizes, SHA256).
- FastAPI: `GET /staging/index?repo&run_id` and `GET /staging/stats`.

### 3.3 Graph Writer (idempotent & resilient)

- **Deterministic keys**:
  - Nodes (examples): `Repo{rid}`, `File{rid}`, `Symbol{rid}`, `Commit{sha}` with `rid=sha1(repo|path|kind)`.
  - Edges keyed by `(start_key,type,end_key,props_hash)`.
- **MERGE-first** Cypher builders; **SET** for mutable props.
- **Redis buffer + DLQ** with backoff; replay CLI drains backlog; outage drill validated.

### 3.4 Query Service (Saved Query Registry)

- Endpoints: `GET /queries`, `POST /queries/{name}`; OpenAPI visible.
- v0.1 saved queries: `repo_overview`, `top_churn`, `sql_lineage_samples`.
- Response envelope includes `{meta:{query,params,elapsed_ms},data:[…]}`.

### 3.5 Reporting (Markdown+Mermaid+PNG)

- Jinja templates (3): Repo Overview, Top Churn, SQL Lineage Sample.
- Outputs at `/reports/{repo}/{ts}/*.md` with fenced Mermaid blocks and **PNG side-cars**.
- Central style tokens (`reporting/style.yml`) and per-run memoized computations.

---

## 4. Data Flow (Authoritative To-Be)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant P2 as Mining
participant P3 as Analysis
participant STG as Staging(JSONL)
participant P4 as GraphWriter
participant MG as Memgraph
participant P5 as Query
participant REP as Reporting

P2->>P3: Analyze file/type-specific payloads
P3->>STG: Append validated Envelope (Contract v0.1)
STG->>STG: index.json finalized per run_id
P4->>STG: Read batch (JSONL)
P4->>MG: MERGE nodes/edges (keys), SET props
alt MG unavailable
P4->>P4: Retry (backoff) then enqueue -> Redis
P4->>P4: DLQ on permanent failure
end
P5->>MG: Run saved Cypher (whitelisted subset)
REP->>P5: Query for tables/diagrams
REP->>REP: Emit Markdown + Mermaid (+PNG)
```

**Idempotency contract:** Running the same batch twice produces **0 new** nodes/edges.

---

## 5. Deployment & Runtime

### 5.1 Compose Profiles (lean)

- `infra`: Redis, Memgraph, Consul (optional)
- `apps-core`: Ingestion, Mining, Analysis, Graph Writer, Query
- `monitor`: Prometheus, Grafana (+exporters)
- Health checks and restart policies applied; startup order: **infra → core → monitor**. platform

### 5.2 Volumes (durable)

- `shared_repositories` (read-mostly post-ingest), `memgraph-data/logs`, `prometheus-data`, `grafana-data`, and **staging** bind.
- Ontology & migration ledger stored in Memgraph and mirrored as files under `ontology/` for version control. platform

---

## 6. Contracts, Ontology & Migrations

### 6.1 Contract v0.1 (Pydantic v2)

- Single source of truth → JSON-Schema; examples shipped; validation on ingress & consume.

### 6.2 Ontology v0.1 (semver)

- `ontology/ontology.yml` defines node labels, rel types, required props, indexes/constraints.
- **Migration pipeline** generates `migrations/*.cypher` and applies **once** at startup; ledger node `:Migration{id,applied_at}`.

### 6.3 Backfill & Evolution

- CLI `backfill --since <ts> --ontology <ver>` reprocesses staged batches without re-ingesting repos.
- Human-in-the-loop: approval to extend ontology triggers backfill of impacted concepts only.

---

## 7. Observability & KPIs

### 7.1 Minimal but meaningful metrics

- **Writer:** `events_received_total`, `nodes_written_total`, `edges_written_total`, `write_failures_total`, `queue_depth_gauge`, `dlq_total`.
- **Staging:** `staged_records_total`, `staged_bytes_total`.
- **Reporting:** `report_build_seconds` (histogram).
- **Usage:** per-analyzer/miner invocation counts (to flag underutilized components).

### 7.2 Grafana Board (single pane)

- Rows: **Ingest→Stage**, **Writer/Queue**, **Reporting**.
- Panels show live increments during `make e2e`.

---

## 8. Query & Reporting

### 8.1 Cypher Compatibility Guard

- Saved queries restricted to a Memgraph-compatible subset; linter blocks Neo4j-only patterns (e.g., APOC).
- 3 queries registered with golden-file tests for stability.

### 8.2 Reports (deterministic output)

- Markdown with fenced Mermaid blocks; **PNG side-car** via CLI for portability in business contexts.
- Outputs versioned per run; directory is “browse-first” for non-engineers.

Example Mermaid fence (kept as code in Markdown and rendered to PNG during build):

```mermaid
graph TD
Repo->File
File->Symbol
Symbol->DependsOn
```

---

## 9. Security & Governance

- Secrets via environment (no logging of secrets); least-privilege container users; health checks + restart policies.
- Compose env parity checked; Redis auth optional in dev, enforced in shared environments.
- No host-privileged containers; named volumes preferred; images built minimal multi-stage. platform

---

## 10. Developer Experience & Standards

- **Make targets:** `seed`, `stage-scan`, `writer-replay`, `reports`, `e2e`, `demo`.
- **Pre-commit:** Ruff, Black, EOF fixer, Cypher linter, Pydantic v2 audit.
- **Tests:** smoke + golden (queries & reports); load test for writer (50k edges).
- **Style:** consistent ports/names; module docstrings concise; README pointers per service. platform

---

## 11. Validation, Demo Script & DoD

### 11.1 Definition of Done (milestone)

- Memgraph holds **≥500 nodes / ≥2,000 edges** (2 repos).
- `/queries` exposes **3** named queries; OpenAPI visible.
- **3** Markdown reports generated with Mermaid + PNG; committed in `/reports/{repo}/{ts}`.
- Grafana panels show non-zero KPIs while running.
- `make e2e` completes from clean state.

### 11.2 Demo (10 minutes)

1. `make seed` → migrations applied once (idempotent).
2. `make e2e` → pipeline run prints report folder path.
3. Open Grafana → KPIs increase (events/nodes/edges/report timings).
4. `POST /queries/top_churn` → JSON result.
5. Open a generated Markdown report and its PNG diagram.

---

## 12. Future Pivots (Non-Blocking)

- **Schema docs auto-publish** (Swagger-like for graph contracts).
- **Hot reload** for app services in dev; CI seeds “golden” data snapshots.
- **Expanded diagramming** beyond Mermaid (ArchiMate, Graphviz) with centralized theming.
- **Policy tier** to orchestrate analyzer/miner mesh by repository profile & historical performance.

---

### Change Log (this version)

- Replaced prior “as-is” narrative with **to-be executable plan** focused on the E2E slice, staging, contract enforcement, idempotent writer, and deterministic reporting.
- Consolidated ports, naming, volumes, and monitoring into a minimum-viable but demo-ready setup. platform

If you want, I can also generate a PR-ready diff (or split this into `docs/` sections) and add a short checklist at the top for reviewers to validate the go-live criteria locally.

### Assistant

Excellent. Below is a curated set of Mermaid diagrams that together explain every major element and the way they interoperate in the to-be architecture. Each block is self-contained, named, and ready to drop into Markdown. If you want, we can split these into `docs/` later and cross-link.

### Assistant

Here’s a precise, no-nonsense prompt you can hand to your coding agent. It includes root-cause hypotheses, verification steps, concrete fixes (code + Compose), and “never again” safeguards with acceptance tests.

TITLE: Fix “Created but not started” services, unify shared volume, and make shared.json_sanitizer importable across services (prevent recurrence)

GOAL

- Services fp-app-mining, fp-app-mining-worker, fp-app-analysis, fp-app-graph-writer start and stay up.
- All services reliably import shared.json_sanitizer.
- A single named volume fp-shared is used by every service (no duplicate fresh-platform_fp-shared).
- Start order is health-gated (infra → shared init → apps).
- CI + preflight doctor catch regressions early.

CONTEXT (observed)

- Containers stuck in Created; no logs when starting via compose.
- Analysis run shows: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'shared.json_sanitizer'.
- Two volumes visible (fp-shared and fresh-platform_fp-shared); trying to ls /var/lib/docker/volumes on macOS host fails (Docker Desktop stores volumes inside Linux VM).
- Manual import test shows package shared importable, but submodule json_sanitizer missing from the shared payload.

SCOPE OF WORK

1. Unify volume naming & Compose profiles/depends_on
2. Make shared.json_sanitizer a real module, included in the built wheel and exposed in the shared volume
3. Ensure all app images install the shared wheel (immutable) and also mount the shared volume (for hotfixes)
4. Enforce health-gated startup (Memgraph, Redis, Shared ready) + add preflight checks
5. Add CI and local “doctor” to prevent regressions

DELIVERABLES

- Updated docker/compose/docker-compose.yml
- Updated shared package layout (shared/json_sanitizer.py + **init**.py; pyproject.toml/setup.py fixed)
- App Dockerfiles updated to install shared wheel
- make doctor and smoke tests
- CI job that builds shared once and validates imports in every service image

EXECUTION PLAN (do in order)

A) Diagnose & normalize Compose

1. Render full config and list profiles:

~~~ bash
docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.yml config > /tmp/compose.full.yaml
grep -n 'profiles:' -n /tmp/compose.full.yaml || true
~~~

1. If any target service (mining, analysis, graph-writer) is behind a profile, ensure we run with the correct profiles (or move them under apps-core). We’ll standardize on profiles: infra, apps-core, monitoring.
2. Unify the shared volume name and remove the duplicate:
  - In docker-compose.yml volumes section, force the externalised name:

~~~
volumes:
  fp-shared:
    name: fp-shared
  shared_repositories:
    name: shared_repositories
~~~

- Replace every service mount of shared with the same host path: /app/shared (read-only for apps).
- Remove any stale project-prefixed volume (this will be recreated cleanly after down):

~~~
docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.yml down -v
docker volume rm -f fresh-platform_fp-shared || true
docker volume rm -f fp-shared || true
docker volume create fp-shared
docker volume create shared_repositories
~~~

B) Shared package: make json_sanitizer real, package it, and expose it

1. Create module and expose via **init**.py.

Files to add under the shared source root (where other shared/*.py live):

~~~ python
# shared/json_sanitizer.py
from __future__ import annotations
import math
from typing import Any
def sanitize_json(obj: Any) -> Any:
 """
 Return a JSON-serializable structure:
 - Convert NaN/Infinity to None
 - Convert sets to sorted lists
 - Convert non-serializable objects via str()
 """
 if obj is None or isinstance(obj, (bool, int, float, str)):
 if isinstance(obj, float) and (math.isnan(obj) or math.isinf(obj)):
 return None
 return obj
 if isinstance(obj, (list, tuple)):
 return [sanitize_json(x) for x in obj]
 if isinstance(obj, set):
 return [sanitize_json(x) for x in sorted(obj, key=lambda v: str(v))]
 if isinstance(obj, dict):
 return {str(k): sanitize_json(v) for k, v in obj.items()}
 # Fallback
 return str(obj)
~~~

And ensure **init**.py exposes it:

~~~ python
# shared/__init__.py
from .json_sanitizer import sanitize_json # re-export
__all__ = ["sanitize_json"]
~~~

1. Ensure packaging includes the shared package. In pyproject.toml (or setup.py), ensure packages are discovered correctly:

~~~ json
# pyproject.toml (excerpt)
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=68", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
[project]
name = "shared"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
dependencies = []
[tool.setuptools.packages.find]
where = ["."]
include = ["shared*"]
exclude = ["tests*"]
~~~

1. Rebuild the shared wheel in the atlantis-shared image stage (already producing /opt/wheels). Verify the wheel contains shared/json_sanitizer.py:

~~~ python
docker build -t atlantis-shared:latest -f p0-shared-services/Dockerfile .
docker run --rm atlantis-shared:latest sh -lc "python - <<'PY'\nimport zipfile,glob\nwhl=sorted(glob.glob('/opt/wheels/shared-*.whl'))[-1]\nprint('WHEEL',whl)\nwith zipfile.ZipFile(whl) as z:\n print([n for n in z.namelist() if 'json_sanitizer.py' in n])\nPY"
~~~

C) Ensure every app image installs the shared wheel (immutable) and also mounts shared volume (for hotfixes)

1. In each app Dockerfile (analysis, mining, graph-writer), add a stage to copy and install wheels:

~~~ python
# near top of app Dockerfile
FROM atlantis-shared:latest AS sharedwheels
# in final stage
COPY --from=sharedwheels /opt/wheels /opt/wheels
RUN /opt/venv/bin/pip install --no-deps /opt/wheels/shared-*.whl
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app:/app/src:/app/shared
~~~

1. Confirm runtime import before starting uvicorn (add a tiny preflight entrypoint or run script):

~~~ python
# analysis/entrypoint.sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh
set -e
python - <<'PY'
import importlib, sys
m = importlib.import_module("shared.json_sanitizer")
print("OK: shared.json_sanitizer importable:", m)
PY
exec python -m uvicorn analysis.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8005
~~~

Make it executable and referenced via command in Compose.

3. Keep the read-only shared volume mount for rapid overrides:

- In compose service:

~~~
volumes:
  - fp-shared:/app/shared:ro
~~~

D) Health-gated startup (infra → shared init → apps)

1. Shared init job should populate /app/shared (volume) and touch /shared/.ready, with healthcheck verifying the sentinel.
2. In docker-compose.yml add depends_on with condition: service_healthy for apps:

~~~ go
services:
  fp-shared-package:
    image: atlantis-shared:latest
    volumes:
      - fp-shared:/shared
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "test -f /shared/.ready"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 30
  fp-app-analysis:
    depends_on:
      fp-infra-redis:
        condition: service_healthy
      fp-infra-memgraph:
        condition: service_healthy
      fp-shared-package:
        condition: service_healthy
    environment:
      - PYTHONPATH=/app:/app/src:/app/shared
    volumes:
      - fp-shared:/app/shared:ro
~~~

1. Ensure the infra has robust healthchecks (you already have Redis ping and Memgraph bolt check). Keep them strict.

E) Compose profiles & start commands

- Keep services under profiles and start with:

~~~
docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.yml --profile infra --profile apps-core --profile monitoring up -d
~~~

- Verify target services aren’t accidentally excluded by a profile or scaled to 0.

F) Smoke tests & doctor (prevent regressions)

1. Add make doctor:

~~~
make doctor
~~~

Should run:

- docker compose config validation
- Confirm single volume name in effective config
- Run per-image import smoke:

~~~ python
docker run --rm -v fp-shared:/app/shared:ro fp-app-analysis:latest \
 python -c "import importlib; import shared; importlib.import_module('shared.json_sanitizer'); print('OK')"
docker run --rm -v fp-shared:/app/shared:ro fp-app-mining:latest \
 python -c "import importlib; importlib.import_module('shared.json_sanitizer'); print('OK')"
docker run --rm -v fp-shared:/app/shared:ro fp-app-graph-writer:latest \
 python -c "import importlib; importlib.import_module('shared.json_sanitizer'); print('OK')"
~~~

1. Golden test: run analysis container with uvicorn after preflight:

~~~
docker run --rm -p 8005:8005 -v shared_repositories:/repositories:ro -v fp-shared:/app/shared:ro \
  --env PYTHONPATH=/app:/app/src:/app/shared fp-app-analysis:latest \
  sh -lc "/app/analysis/entrypoint.sh"
~~~

Expect “OK: shared.json_sanitizer importable” then server start.

3. CI job:

- Build atlantis-shared → produce wheels
- Build each app image → install shared wheel
- Run the three import checks above in CI
- Fail CI if any import fails or if multiple shared volumes appear in docker compose config.

G) Cleanup & restart

~~~
docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.yml down -v
docker volume rm -f fp-shared fresh-platform_fp-shared || true
docker volume create fp-shared
docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.yml --profile infra up -d
docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.yml --profile infra --profile apps-core --profile monitoring up -d
docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.yml ps
~~~

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- docker compose ps shows fp-app-mining, fp-app-mining-worker, fp-app-analysis, fp-app-graph-writer all Up (or Healthy) — not Created.
- Each app logs a one-time “OK: shared.json_sanitizer importable” at startup.
- Single volume named fp-shared in docker volume ls; no fresh-platform_fp-shared leftovers.
- make doctor passes locally and in CI.
- A clean down/up sequence reproduces the above.

NOTES (why this prevents recurrence)

- Installing the shared wheel into each image removes runtime dependency on the volume for module availability (the volume is now an override, not a crutch).
- Health-gated depends_on prevents “Created but not started” due to racing dependencies.
- A single, externally named volume avoids Docker Desktop’s project-prefixed duplicates.
- The doctor + CI smoke keeps module importability and compose integrity continuously validated.

### Assistant

Here’s a tight, agent-ready checklist to fix the infra issue and harden it so it won’t recur. Execute top-to-bottom.

Preparation

[ ] Render effective compose and confirm profiles in use

~~~ bash
docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.yml config > /tmp/compose.full.yaml
grep -n 'profiles:' /tmp/compose.full.yaml || true
~~~

[ ] Identify any services (mining, analysis, graph-writer, mining-worker) hidden behind profiles and confirm they belong to apps-core (or will be invoked with the right profiles).

Normalize volumes (one canonical shared volume)

[ ] In docker/compose/docker-compose.yml, define volumes with fixed names:

~~~ yaml
volumes:
  fp-shared:
    name: fp-shared
  shared_repositories:
    name: shared_repositories
~~~

[ ] Ensure every app service mounts fp-shared at /app/shared:ro and shared_repositories at /repositories:ro.

[ ] Nuke duplicates and recreate volumes cleanly:

~~~ bash
docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.yml down -v
docker volume rm -f fresh-platform_fp-shared || true
docker volume rm -f fp-shared || true
docker volume create fp-shared
docker volume create shared_repositories
~~~

Make shared.json_sanitizer a real package (and export it)

[ ] Add shared/json_sanitizer.py with a robust sanitize_json function.

[ ] Ensure shared/**init**.py re-exports sanitize_json.

[ ] Fix packaging to include shared*:

~~~ json
# pyproject.toml (key excerpts)
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=68", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
[project]
name = "shared"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
[tool.setuptools.packages.find]
where = ["."]
include = ["shared*"]
exclude = ["tests*"]
~~~

Rebuild shared image + wheels and verify contents

[ ] Build atlantis-shared and confirm wheel contains json_sanitizer:

~~~ python
docker build -t atlantis-shared:latest -f p0-shared-services/Dockerfile .
docker run --rm atlantis-shared:latest sh -lc 'python - <<PY
import zipfile,glob
whl=sorted(glob.glob("/opt/wheels/shared-*.whl"))[-1]
print("WHEEL", whl)
with zipfile.ZipFile(whl) as z:
 print([n for n in z.namelist() if "json_sanitizer.py" in n])
PY'
~~~

Install shared wheel in every app image (immutable baseline)

[ ] In each app Dockerfile (analysis, mining, graph-writer, mining-worker) add:

~~~ python
FROM atlantis-shared:latest AS sharedwheels
# ... your app build base/stages ...
COPY --from=sharedwheels /opt/wheels /opt/wheels
RUN /opt/venv/bin/pip install --no-deps /opt/wheels/shared-*.whl
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app:/app/src:/app/shared
~~~

[ ] Rebuild all app images.

Add startup preflight import check (fast fail)

[ ] Create analysis/entrypoint.sh (similar for others) to verify import before starting uvicorn:

~~~ python
#!/usr/bin/env sh
set -e
python - <<'PY'
import importlib
importlib.import_module("shared.json_sanitizer")
print("OK: shared.json_sanitizer importable")
PY
exec python -m uvicorn analysis.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8005
~~~

[ ] Make executable and wire in compose service command.

Health-gated startup sequence

[ ] Ensure infra healthchecks are strict (Redis ping; Memgraph bolt_check.py).

[ ] Shared init job: populates /shared and touches /shared/.ready; add healthcheck:

~~~ go
services:
  fp-shared-package:
    image: atlantis-shared:latest
    volumes:
      - fp-shared:/shared
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "test -f /shared/.ready"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 30
~~~

[ ] Add depends_on (condition: service_healthy) for apps:

~~~ go
  fp-app-analysis:
    depends_on:
      fp-infra-redis: { condition: service_healthy }
      fp-infra-memgraph: { condition: service_healthy }
      fp-shared-package: { condition: service_healthy }
    volumes:
      - fp-shared:/app/shared:ro
      - shared_repositories:/repositories:ro
    environment:
      - PYTHONPATH=/app:/app/src:/app/shared
~~~

Start with correct profiles and verify

[ ] Bring up infra first, then core + monitoring:

~~~ bash
docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.yml --profile infra up -d
docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.yml --profile infra --profile apps-core --profile monitoring up -d
docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.yml ps
~~~

Smoke tests (local)

[ ] One-shot import checks per image:

~~~ python
docker run --rm -v fp-shared:/app/shared:ro fp-app-analysis:latest \
 python -c "import importlib; importlib.import_module('shared.json_sanitizer'); print('OK')"
docker run --rm -v fp-shared:/app/shared:ro fp-app-mining:latest \
 python -c "import importlib; importlib.import_module('shared.json_sanitizer'); print('OK')"
docker run --rm -v fp-shared:/app/shared:ro fp-app-graph-writer:latest \
 python -c "import importlib; importlib.import_module('shared.json_sanitizer'); print('OK')"
~~~

[ ] Run analysis service with entrypoint (expect “OK: … importable” then server starts):

~~~ bash
docker run --rm -p 8005:8005 \
-v shared_repositories:/repositories:ro -v fp-shared:/app/shared:ro \
--env PYTHONPATH=/app:/app/src:/app/shared fp-app-analysis:latest \
sh -lc "/app/analysis/entrypoint.sh"
~~~

Doctor target (prevent regressions locally)

[ ] Add make target:

~~~ python
doctor:
\t@docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.yml config >/dev/null || (echo "Compose config invalid" && exit 1)
\t@docker volume ls --format '{{.Name}}' | grep -qx 'fp-shared' || (echo "fp-shared volume missing" && exit 1)
\t@docker run --rm -v fp-shared:/app/shared:ro fp-app-analysis:latest \
\t python -c "import importlib; importlib.import_module('shared.json_sanitizer')" >/dev/null || (echo "analysis cannot import shared.json_sanitizer" && exit 1)
\t@docker run --rm -v fp-shared:/app/shared:ro fp-app-mining:latest \
\t python -c "import importlib; importlib.import_module('shared.json_sanitizer')" >/dev/null || (echo "mining cannot import shared.json_sanitizer" && exit 1)
\t@docker run --rm -v fp-shared:/app/shared:ro fp-app-graph-writer:latest \
\t python -c "import importlib; importlib.import_module('shared.json_sanitizer')" >/dev/null || (echo "writer cannot import shared.json_sanitizer" && exit 1)
\t@echo "doctor: OK"
~~~

CI safeguards

[ ] CI pipeline stages:

[ ] Build atlantis-shared (publish wheels as artifact/workspace).

[ ] Build app images; install shared wheel.

[ ] Run the three import smoke checks (above) inside CI runner.

[ ] Lint effective compose config and ensure only one shared volume name appears (fp-shared).

[ ] Fail CI on any import/compose/volume check error.

Cleanup & reproducible restart

[ ] Full recycle to ensure deterministic startup:

~~~ bash
docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.yml down -v
docker volume rm -f fp-shared fresh-platform_fp-shared || true
docker volume create fp-shared
docker volume create shared_repositories
docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.yml --profile infra up -d
docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.yml --profile infra --profile apps-core --profile monitoring up -d
docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.yml ps
~~~

Acceptance criteria (mark all)

[ ] fp-app-mining, fp-app-mining-worker, fp-app-analysis, fp-app-graph-writer are Up/Healthy (not Created).

[ ] Startup logs show “OK: shared.json_sanitizer importable” once per app.

[ ] docker volume ls shows a single fp-shared (no fresh-platform_fp-shared).

[ ] make doctor returns “doctor: OK”.

[ ] CI job passes compose/volume/import checks.

Post-fix hygiene (optional but recommended)

[ ] Add pre-commit hook or CI step to grep effective compose for stray volume names not equal to fp-shared.

[ ] Add a simple /health/import_check endpoint in each app that attempts import of shared.json_sanitizer and returns 200/500 accordingly.

[ ] Document the shared package contract and the two paths of availability: immutable (wheel in image) and override (mounted read-only volume).

### Assistant

Here’s a tight, agent-ready PROMPT + CHECKLIST to make Python versioning uniform across all Dockerfiles, plus a ready-to-commit docs/matrices page that shows versions across the stack (and how to keep it updated automatically).

# ================================================================
PROMPT FOR CODING AGENT — “UNIFY PYTHON VERSIONING + DOC MATRICES”

Goal

- Enforce one baseline Python version (3.12.x) across all Dockerfiles and CI.
- Pin digests for repeatable builds.
- Allow tightly-controlled exceptions (documented + justified).
- Generate docs/versions.md with matrices of versions per service/tool.
- Add CI checks to prevent regressions.

Scope

- Rework every Dockerfile in repository heads:
  - ci.Dockerfile
  - p1-ingestion-service/Dockerfile
  - p2-mining-service/Dockerfile
  - p2-mining-service/Dockerfile.worker
  - p3-analysis-service/Dockerfile
  - p4-graph-writer/Dockerfile
  - p4-graph-writer/Dockerfile.bak (delete if obsolete)
  - p5-query-service/Dockerfile
  - p6-reporting-service/Dockerfile
  - p9-orchestration-service/Dockerfile
  - shared/Dockerfile
  - shared-package/Dockerfile
- Compose + Makefile updates (central ARG/ENV).
- CI guard (lint + script) and Renovate/Dependabot rules.
- Generate docs/versions.md matrices (runtime, tools, infra).

Baseline Policy

- Baseline Python: 3.12 (slim) — exact tag via .env: PYTHON_VERSION=3.12.6
- Pin digest (ARG PYTHON_DIGEST=sha256:…).
- All app images: FROM python:${PYTHON_VERSION}-slim@${PYTHON_DIGEST}
- Exceptions (e.g., 3.11 for binary constraints) must be:
  1. minimized; 2) documented in docs/versions.md; 3) tracked in a follow-up issue to migrate; 4) whitelisted in CI.

Deliverables

1. docker/compose/.env (or top-level .env)
2. Makefile targets
3. Updated Dockerfiles using centralized ARGs
4. .github/workflows/python-version-guard.yml
5. scripts/verify_python_matrix.py
6. docs/versions.md (matrices + generation notes)
7. Renovate rules in renovate.json (optional) or Dependabot config

Implementation steps

- Add central version pins + digests

~~~
# .env (new or updated)
PYTHON_VERSION=3.12.6
PYTHON_DIGEST=sha256:REPLACE_ME_WITH_REAL_DIGEST
~~~

- Refactor each Dockerfile to use the ARG (example pattern)

~~~
ARG PYTHON_VERSION=3.12.6
ARG PYTHON_DIGEST=sha256:REPLACE_ME_WITH_REAL_DIGEST
FROM python:${PYTHON_VERSION}-slim@${PYTHON_DIGEST} AS base
# If multi-stage:
# FROM base AS build
# FROM base AS final
~~~

- For images that must remain on 3.11 or 3.13 (temporary):
  - Add a comment header explaining the constraint, link the tracking issue, and keep the same ARGs but override at build via build-args in compose (explicit deviation).
  - Add them to an allowlist in scripts/verify_python_matrix.py.
- Compose: pass args globally (build section) or per-service

~~~
# docker/compose/docker-compose.yml (snippet)
x-python-build-args: &python_args
  args:
    PYTHON_VERSION: ${PYTHON_VERSION}
    PYTHON_DIGEST: ${PYTHON_DIGEST}
services:
  fp-app-analysis:
    build:
      context: ./p3-analysis-service
      <<: *python_args
  # repeat for all Python-based services
~~~

- Makefile helpers

~~~ python
# Makefile
print-python:
\t@echo "PYTHON_VERSION=${PYTHON_VERSION} DIGEST=${PYTHON_DIGEST}"
update-python:
\t@sed -i'' -e "s/^PYTHON_VERSION=.*/PYTHON_VERSION=${PYTHON_VERSION}/" .env
\t@sed -i'' -e "s/^PYTHON_DIGEST=.*/PYTHON_DIGEST=${PYTHON_DIGEST}/" .env
~~~

- CI guard (fails if any Dockerfile deviates or uses unpinned base)

~~~ python
# .github/workflows/python-version-guard.yml
name: Python Version Guard
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
 guard:
 runs-on: ubuntu-latest
 steps:
 - uses: actions/checkout@v4
 - name: Verify Python version matrix
 run: |
 python3 - <<'PY'
import os, re, sys, glob, json
ALLOW = {
 # path -> allowed version override (temporary)
 # "p3-analysis-service/Dockerfile": "3.11",
}
env = {}
for line in open(".env"):
 if "=" in line:
 k,v = line.strip().split("=",1)
 env[k]=v
base_ver = env.get("PYTHON_VERSION","3.12.6").split(".",2)[:2]
base_major_minor = ".".join(base_ver)
fails=[]
for df in glob.glob("**/Dockerfile*", recursive=True):
 txt=open(df).read()
 m=re.search(r"FROM\s+python:(\d+\.\d+)(?:\.\d+)?-slim", txt)
 if not m:
 fails.append((df,"no FROM python:X.Y-slim found"))
 continue
 ver=m.group(1)
 if df in ALLOW:
 if not ver.startswith(ALLOW[df]):
 fails.append((df,f"expected {ALLOW[df]}.* but found {ver}"))
 else:
 if ver!=base_major_minor:
 fails.append((df,f"expected {base_major_minor}.* but found {ver}"))
 if "@sha256:" not in txt:
 fails.append((df,"base image is not digest-pinned"))
if fails:
 print("Python version guard failed:")
 for f,r in fails:
 print(" -",f,"=>",r)
 sys.exit(1)
print("Python version guard OK")
PY
~~~

- Optional: Renovate rule (keeps .env PYTHON_VERSION in sync)

~~~
{
  "regexManagers": [
    {
      "fileMatch": ["^\\.env$"],
      "matchStrings": ["PYTHON_VERSION=(?<currentValue>\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+)"],
      "depNameTemplate": "python",
      "datasourceTemplate": "docker",
      "versioningTemplate": "semver"
    }
  ]
}
~~~

- Generate docs matrix (script emits Markdown tables into docs/versions.md)

~~~ json
# scripts/verify_python_matrix.py (also prints a Markdown table)
# (keep the version guard logic; add a --md flag to write docs/versions.md)
~~~

Acceptance Criteria

- All Python-based Dockerfiles use python:${PYTHON_VERSION}-slim@${PYTHON_DIGEST} (3.12.x baseline), except documented/allowed exceptions.
- CI guard passes; digest pin enforced.
- docs/versions.md exists with matrices, is accurate, and includes the per-service Python table + tools/infra versions.
- “update-python” path (changing .env + digest) triggers a green rebuild everywhere.

Rollback/Exception Handling

- If a service cannot move to 3.12 immediately, document it in docs/versions.md “Exceptions” and add to CI allowlist with a tracking issue and owner/date.

If you want, I can also provide a tiny Python script that parses all Dockerfiles + requirements files and auto-rewrites docs/versions.md (plug-and-play).

### Assistant

Here’s a precise, agent-ready prompt you can drop into your runbook. It diagnoses likely root causes, shows two safe packaging layouts (pick one), gives exact pyproject/setuptools fixes, and adds “never again” guards (wheel inspection, import smoke, CI).

# ================================================================
PROMPT — FIX SHARED PACKAGE PACKAGING & INCLUDE json_sanitizer

Objective

- Ensure wheel for the shared package reliably contains shared/json_sanitizer.py.
- Make imports like `from shared.json_sanitizer import sanitize_json` work in all services.
- Add automated guards so this cannot regress.

Context

- Current wheel sometimes omits json_sanitizer. Root causes usually are:
  1. Wrong package discovery (no src-layout config or wrong include patterns).
  2. Missing **init**.py (namespace pkg mis-detected).
  3. Two “shared” directories in tree; setuptools picks the wrong one.
  4. MANIFEST.in or pyproject excludes defaulting out files.
  5. Building from the wrong directory (no pyproject at build root).

Execution Plan (choose ONE packaging layout; A is recommended)

A) src-layout (recommended, least ambiguous)

1. Restructure to:

~~~ go
p0-shared-services/
  shared/                # repo directory name; not the Python package
    pyproject.toml
    src/
      shared/
        __init__.py
        json_sanitizer.py
    tests/
~~~

1. pyproject.toml (authoritative)

~~~ go
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=68", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
[project]
name = "shared"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
description = "Fresh Platform shared utilities"
dependencies = []
[tool.setuptools]
package-dir = {"" = "src"}
[tool.setuptools.packages.find]
where = ["src"]
include = ["shared*"]
exclude = ["tests*"]
[tool.setuptools.package-data]
shared = []
~~~

1. Sanity: ensure both files exist

~~~
src/shared/__init__.py
src/shared/json_sanitizer.py
~~~

B) flat-layout (only if you cannot move to src/)

1. Keep layout:

~~~
p0-shared-services/
  shared/
    __init__.py
    json_sanitizer.py
  pyproject.toml
  tests/
~~~

1. pyproject.toml:

~~~ json
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=68", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
[project]
name = "shared"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
[tool.setuptools.packages.find]
where = ["."]
include = ["shared*"]
exclude = ["tests*"]
~~~

Build & Verify (do this inside p0-shared-services)

1. Clean & build with PEP 517:

~~~
python -m pip install -U build
python -m build  # creates dist/*.whl and dist/*.tar.gz
~~~

1. Inspect wheel contents:

~~~ python
python - <<'PY'
import zipfile, glob, sys
whl = sorted(glob.glob("dist/*.whl"))[-1]
print("WHEEL:", whl)
with zipfile.ZipFile(whl) as z:
 names = z.namelist()
 print("HAS json_sanitizer:", any(n.endswith("shared/json_sanitizer.py") for n in names))
 [print(" ", n) for n in names if "shared/" in n]
PY
~~~

1. Install the wheel in a clean venv and import:

~~~ python
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --no-cache-dir dist/shared-*.whl
python - <<'PY'
import shared, importlib, pkgutil
print("shared at:", shared.__file__)
m = importlib.import_module("shared.json_sanitizer")
print("OK:", m.__name__, "loaded")
PY
~~~

Docker Integration (immutable baseline + runtime override)

1. In the shared image stage that builds wheels (atlantis-shared), ensure the build context is the package root with pyproject.toml. Then:

~~~
/opt/venv/bin/pip install -U pip setuptools wheel build
python -m build
cp -r dist/*.whl /opt/wheels/
~~~

1. In every app Dockerfile (analysis, mining, graph-writer, query, reporting):

~~~ python
ARG PYTHON_VERSION=3.12.6
ARG PYTHON_DIGEST=sha256:REPLACE
FROM atlantis-shared:latest AS sharedwheels
# final stage...
COPY --from=sharedwheels /opt/wheels /opt/wheels
RUN /opt/venv/bin/pip install --no-deps /opt/wheels/shared-*.whl
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app:/app/src:/app/shared
~~~

1. Keep the read-only volume mount for /app/shared as an optional override, but do not rely on it for availability of the module.

Never-Again Guards

1. Wheel inspection test (repo root):

~~~
make test-shared-wheel
~~~

Implement:

~~~ python
python - <<'PY'
import zipfile, glob, sys
whl = sorted(glob.glob("**/dist/shared-*.whl", recursive=True))[-1]
with zipfile.ZipFile(whl) as z:
 assert any(n.endswith("shared/json_sanitizer.py") for n in z.namelist()), "json_sanitizer missing in wheel"
print("OK: json_sanitizer found in", whl)
PY
~~~

1. Import smoke per image:

~~~ python
docker run --rm fp-app-analysis:latest \
 python -c "import importlib; importlib.import_module('shared.json_sanitizer'); print('OK')"
~~~

(repeat for mining, writer, query, reporting)

3) CI job (required):

- Build shared wheel (PEP 517)
- Run “Wheel inspection test”
- Build each app image and run the import smoke inside the container
- Fail PR if any step fails

Acceptance Criteria

- dist/shared-*.whl contains shared/json_sanitizer.py.
- `python -c "import shared.json_sanitizer"` succeeds in a clean venv and in every app container.
- App containers no longer depend on the volume for module availability (wheel is sufficient).
- CI blocks merges if wheel is missing the module or any container fails the import smoke.

Optional Hardening

- If the module name “shared” risks collisions, introduce internal package `fresh_shared` and keep a top-level `shared/__init__.py` shim:

~~~ python
# shared/__init__.py
from fresh_shared.json_sanitizer import * # noqa
~~~

Document the shim in docs/versions.md and plan migration.

# ================================================================
CHECKLIST (tick top-to-bottom)

[ ] Choose layout: src-layout (A) preferred; else flat-layout (B).

[ ] Add/confirm `shared/__init__.py` and `shared/json_sanitizer.py`.

[ ] Fix pyproject.toml as shown (package discovery matches layout).

[ ] Build wheel with `python -m build`.

[ ] Inspect wheel → contains `shared/json_sanitizer.py`.

[ ] Clean venv install → import `shared.json_sanitizer` ok.

[ ] Update atlantis-shared image to produce `/opt/wheels/shared-*.whl`.

[ ] Update all app Dockerfiles to `pip install /opt/wheels/shared-*.whl`.

[ ] Keep `/app/shared:ro` mount only as optional override.

[ ] Add “wheel inspection” and “container import smoke” tests.

[ ] Wire CI to fail on missing module or failed imports.

[ ] Document result + guardrails in `docs/versions.md` (Shared package row updated).

### Assistant

Here are three radically different, end-to-end stacks that deliver your same capabilities (ingest → mine/analyze → graph write → query → report → monitor), each with clear trade-offs, why you’d pick it, and how you could pilot it in 48 hours.

# Option A — Rust + Redpanda + Neo4j Aura + mdBook (performance-first)

### Components

- Runtime: Rust (tokio/axum) for miners/analyzers/writer/query.
- Parsing: tree-sitter for Python/SQL; `sqlglot-rs` alternatives or call out to Python via FFI for tricky dialects.
- Transport: Redpanda (Kafka API–compatible, easy ops) topics: `events.staged`, `writer.dlq`.
- Staging: S3-compatible bucket (MinIO locally) with object versioning; envelopes as newline JSON.
- Graph: Neo4j Aura (managed) for zero infra; bolt+routing with `neo4rs`.
- Schema/Ontology: versioned DSL in YAML → compiled to Cypher migrations at build time.
- Query service: axum GraphQL (async-graphql) or REST; saved queries as compiled Cypher.
- Reporting: mdBook with pre-build step that injects Markdown & Mermaid; PNG via `mermaid-cli` container.
- Monitoring: OpenTelemetry (otlp) → Grafana Tempo/Loki/Prometheus stack or Honeycomb.
- Build: Cargo workspaces; cross for multi-arch; Nix optional for hermetic dev.

### Why pick it

- Very small, fast containers; memory-safe miners/analyzers; superb throughput on writer.
- Redpanda simplifies Kafka ops; Aura eliminates graph DB admin for the critical path.
- mdBook produces elegant, versioned docs with minimal ceremony.

### Risks

- Rust learning curve for the team; fewer off-the-shelf SQL lineage libs than Python.
- Some Memgraph-specific Cypher features may need porting/adjustment.

### 48-hour pilot slice

- Implement Envelope v0.1 in Rust (serde) + S3 staging write/read.
- Writer: idempotent MERGE with deterministic keys; Redpanda buffering; DLQ stream.
- Saved queries (3) + mdBook with one lineage diagram auto-generated.
- Dashboards: Prom counters for events/edges/latency; one Grafana board.

---

# Option B — Go + NATS JetStream + Dgraph + Hugo (operational simplicity)

### Components

- Runtime: Go (chi or fiber) for services; goroutines for miners/analyzers; `go-tree-sitter` parsers.
- Transport: NATS JetStream (streams + durable consumers) for staging, writer backlog, DLQ.
- Staging: local/remote FS with content-addressed files (SHA256) + index JSON; NATS subjects carry pointers.
- Graph: Dgraph (native distributed graph) with built-in GraphQL; Go client simplifies writes.
- Schema/Ontology: Dgraph schema files under version control; migrations applied via `dgraph live` or GraphQL schema updates.
- Query service: use Dgraph GraphQL directly; wrap with a thin Go API for saved queries & auth.
- Reporting: Hugo static site build; data pulled during build via small Go generators → Markdown + Mermaid + PNG.
- Monitoring: OpenTelemetry SDK for Go + Prometheus exporter; NATS JetStream metrics surfaces queue depth & acks.
- Build: Go modules; `ko` or plain Docker; tiny images (FROM `gcr.io/distroless/base`).

### Why pick it

- Very low ops overhead; single binary services; NATS is lightweight and blazingly fast.
- Dgraph gives GraphQL out of the box, shortening time to first query/report.

### Risks

- Dgraph operational maturity considerations (backups/ACLs) vs. managed services.
- If you need Cypher semantics, translation is required.

### 48-hour pilot slice

- Define Dgraph schema for Repo/File/Symbol/Commit + relations; apply.
- Implement writer with upsert keys → idempotent mutations; JetStream DLQ.
- Expose 3 saved GraphQL queries; generate 2 Hugo pages with tables + Mermaid.
- Grafana: JetStream stream depth, writer success/fail, report build seconds.

---

# Option C — TypeScript/Node + Temporal + ArangoDB (multi-model) + Docusaurus (DX-first)

### Components

- Runtime: Node.js (Fastify) + TypeScript for all services; Zod for schema; ts-morph/Tree-sitter WASM for parsing.
- Orchestration: Temporal (durable workflows/activities) to model miner→analyzer→writer steps with retries, backoff, idempotency built-in.
- Transport/Staging: Temporal’s histories + S3 (or local FS) for payloads; workers stream tasks; DLQ via Temporal “dead letter” mechanism or side channel (Redis optional).
- Graph: ArangoDB (multi-model: graph + doc); Foxx services if needed; AQL and graph traversals; schema captured as ArangoSearch views + collections + edge definitions versioned under code.
- Query service: Fastify REST + saved AQL templates; or GraphQL via `graphql-yoga` with resolvers that call AQL.
- Reporting: Docusaurus + MDX; build step fetches data and emits Markdown + Mermaid; PNG via Puppeteer.
- Monitoring: OpenTelemetry (auto-instrument Node) → Prom/Grafana; Temporal Web UI gives workflow introspection.
- Build: pnpm workspaces; Docker multi-stage with `node:20-slim`.

### Why pick it

- Developer-friendly stack; Temporal gives first-class retries, backfills, and “human-in-the-loop” pausing.
- Arango’s multi-model simplifies mixing metadata documents and graph edges in one engine.

### Risks

- Temporal adds a control-plane component (operationally heavier than bare queues).
- AQL syntax differs from Cypher; migration effort if you later switch graphs.

### 48-hour pilot slice

- Define Zod Envelope schemas; workers to stage → write graph → mark steps complete.
- Arango: collections & edge definitions + startup migration; implement idempotent upserts.
- Expose 3 saved AQL queries; Docusaurus site with two MDX pages & Mermaid.
- Grafana + Temporal Web show end-to-end flow and retries.

## Cross-option comparison (quick read)

| Axis | A: Rust+Redpanda+Neo4j | B: Go+NATS+Dgraph | C: TS+Temporal+Arango |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Speed/Footprint | ★★★★☆ (very small, fast) | ★★★★☆ (tiny binaries) | ★★★☆☆ |
| Ops Complexity | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★☆ (simple) | ★★☆☆☆ (Temporal adds control plane) |
| Graph Model | Cypher (Neo4j managed) | Native Graph + GraphQL | Multi-model (AQL graph) |
| Dev Ergonomics | Strong typing; steep curve | Straightforward | Very high DX; rich ecosystem |
| Backfill/Retry | Custom in code | JetStream durable consumers | Temporal built-in |
| Reporting UX | mdBook + CLI | Hugo + generators | Docusaurus + MDX |
| “48h demo” feasibility | High | High | Medium-High |

---

## Minimal pilot plan (any option)

1. Lock a tiny domain: Repo + File + Symbol + Commit + `DEPENDS_ON` edges.
2. Implement Envelope v0.1 + deterministic keys; stage 100–200 events.
3. Write idempotently; show `run twice → 0 new edges`.
4. Expose 3 saved queries.
5. Generate 2 Markdown pages (tables + one Mermaid).
6. Dashboard with: events_received, nodes_written, edges_written, write_failures, queue_depth, report_build_seconds.
7. Record demo script and outputs folder; compare diffs across two runs.

If you want, pick one option and I’ll convert your current checklist and tickets into that stack’s concrete components (Dockerfiles, service skeletons, Make targets, and a 10-minute demo script).

### Assistant

Below are three pragmatic infra/orchestration alternatives that keep **Python** + **Memgraph**, but materially improve resilience, scaling, and operability. Each option includes: rationale, core components, a 48-hour pilot plan, key manifests/snippets, and a crisp go/no-go checklist. Pick one and I’ll convert it into ready-to-run files.

---

# Option 1 — Kubernetes + Argo Workflows + NATS JetStream (cloud-native, burstable)

## Why this

- Clear separation of **control-plane orchestration** (Argo) from **data-plane services** (FastAPI).
- **NATS JetStream** replaces ad-hoc queues (durable streams, easy consumers), enabling backpressure + replay without Redis coupling.
- **KEDA** autoscaling on queue lag (per miner/analyzer/graph-writer).
- **Memgraph** as a StatefulSet with PVCs; simple rolling updates; PodDisruptionBudgets.

## Core components

- **Argo Workflows**: run miner→analyzer→writer DAGs per repo/run_id.
- **NATS JetStream**: `staging.events`, `writer.main`, `writer.dlq`.
- **Ingress**: Traefik or NGINX; cert-manager for TLS.
- **Obs**: OpenTelemetry (OTLP) → Prometheus/Grafana; Loki for logs.

## 48-hour pilot (minimal)

1. Package containers; publish to registry.
2. Deploy NATS + Memgraph + Prom/Grafana via Helm.
3. Argo workflow:

`step1: ingestion` → `step2: miners (fan-out)` → `step3: analyzers` → append JSONL to shared volume + emit NATS pointers → `step4: writer drain`.
4. Expose Query/Reporting behind Ingress.
5. KEDA ScaledObject: autoscale writer on `writer.main` lag.
6. Dashboards: events_received, nodes_written, edges_written, failures, queue_depth, report_build_seconds.

### KEDA autoscale on NATS lag (writer)

~~~
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata: { name: writer-scale }
spec:
  scaleTargetRef: { name: graph-writer-deploy }

      stream: "writer"
      consumer: "main"
      lagThreshold: "1000"
~~~

## Go/No-Go (pilot)

- Argo run completes; writer idempotency verified (2nd drain == 0 new edges).
- p95 query < 200ms; dashboards show non-zero KPIs.
- Pod restarts do **not** drop data (NATS durable consumers + Memgraph PVC).

---

# Option 2 — Nomad + Consul + Vault + Redis Streams (ops-lean, self-hosted)

## Why this

- **Nomad** gives simple scheduling without full K8s complexity.
- **Consul** for service discovery/health; **Vault** for secrets.
- **Redis Streams** (not RQ) for durable queues and replay; easy to reason about.

## Core components

- Jobs: ingestion, miners, analyzers, writer, query, reporting as Nomad services.
- Redis Streams: `staging.events`, `writer.main`, `writer.dlq`.
- Rolling updates + canaries via Nomad update stanza.
- Consul intentions + health for safe routing.

## 48-hour pilot

1. Define Nomad jobs for query/reporting/writer.
2. Redis Streams pipeline; writer consumer group with retry/DLQ.
3. Health checks in Consul; dashboards via Prom/Grafana agents.

## Snippets

### Nomad job (writer)

~~~
job "graph-writer" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  group "writer" {
    count = 2
    network { port "http" { to = 8004 } }
    service {
      name = "graph-writer"
      port = "http"
      check { type = "http", path = "/health", interval = "5s", timeout = "2s" }
    }
    task "app" {
      driver = "docker"
      config {
        image = "ghcr.io/yourorg/fp-app-graph-writer:latest"
        ports = ["http"]
      }
      env {
        REDIS_URL = "redis://fp-redis:6379/0"
        MEMGRAPH_BOLT = "bolt://memgraph.service.consul:7687"
      }
      resources { cpu = 500; memory = 512 }
    }
    update { max_parallel = 1; min_healthy_time = "10s"; healthy_deadline = "2m"; auto_revert = true }
  }
}
~~~

### Redis Streams consumer (Python outline)

~~~ python
from redis import Redis
from redis.client import Pipeline
r = Redis.from_url("redis://fp-redis:6379/0")
GROUP = "writer"
STREAM = "writer.main"
DLQ = "writer.dlq"
def drain():
 try:
 r.xgroup_create(STREAM, GROUP, id="$", mkstream=True)
 except Exception: pass
 while True:
 msgs = r.xreadgroup(GROUP, "writer-1", {STREAM: ">"}, count=100, block=2000)
 for _, entries in msgs or []:
 for msg_id, kv in entries:
 ok = process(kv)
 if ok:
 r.xack(STREAM, GROUP, msg_id)
 else:
 r.xadd(DLQ, kv)
 r.xack(STREAM, GROUP, msg_id)
~~~

## Go/No-Go (pilot)

- Nomad shows writer/query/reporting **running** with health OK.
- Stream lag stable; retries work; DLQ populated on poison.
- One-command deployment + rollback demonstrated.

---

# Option 3 — Temporal (Python) + Compose++/Swarm (keep Docker, add durable workflows)

## Why this

- You keep Docker/Compose yet gain **durable orchestration**: retries, backoff, idempotency keys, backfill are **built in**.
- Great for human-in-the-loop ontology approvals → auto backfill afterwards.

## Core components

- **Temporal Server** (managed Cloud or self-hosted).
- **Python workers** implement activities: ingest, mine, analyze, stage, write.
- **Workflows** express repo/run pipeline; emit metrics; DLQ handled via workflow failure hooks.

## 48-hour pilot

1. Stand up Temporal (docker-compose), Web UI included.
2. Implement workflow `ProcessRepo(run_id, repo)` with activities.
3. Replace RQ with Temporal tasks; keep Memgraph/Redis infra.
4. Add “BackfillWorkflow(since_ts, ontology_ver)” that replays staged batches.

## Snippets

### Temporal Python workflow (skeleton)

~~~ python
from temporalio import workflow, activity
@activity.defn
async def run_miner(run_id: str): ...
@activity.defn
async def run_analyzers(run_id: str): ...
@activity.defn
async def writer_drain(run_id: str): ...
@workflow.defn
class ProcessRepo:
 @workflow.run
 async def run(self, run_id: str, repo: str):
 await workflow.execute_activity(run_miner, run_id, start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=10), retry_policy={"maximum_attempts": 5})
 await workflow.execute_activity(run_analyzers, run_id, start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=10), retry_policy={"maximum_attempts": 5})
 await workflow.execute_activity(writer_drain, run_id, start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=30), retry_policy={"maximum_attempts": 5})
~~~

## Go/No-Go (pilot)

- Temporal Web shows successful runs & retries on injected failures.
- “BackfillWorkflow” runs without re-ingest; Memgraph idempotency holds.
- Demo: kill writer container mid-run → workflow retries → run completes.

---

## Migration decision aid (quick)

| Criterion | K8s+Argo+NATS | Nomad+Consul+Redis Streams | Temporal+Compose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Operational overhead | High (managed K8s helps) | Low-Medium | Low |
| Orchestration power | High (DAGs, events) | Medium (jobs + scripts) | Very High (durable workflows) |
| Queueing semantics | JetStream (durable, rich) | Streams (durable, simple) | Built-in via workflows |
| Team familiarity | Often moderate | High if already on HashiCorp | High (Python) |
| 48h pilot feasibility | High | High | High |

---

## “Agent prompt” to execute chosen option (template)

~~~ make
TASK: Migrate orchestration/infra while keeping Python + Memgraph. Deliver a 48h pilot slice with end-to-end run, retries, idempotency, dashboards.
CHOICE: <fill: option-1-k8s-argo-nats | option-2-nomad-redis | option-3-temporal-compose>
ACCEPTANCE:
- End-to-end run on 2 repos; second writer drain yields 0 new nodes/edges.
- p95 query < 200ms; Grafana shows KPIs (events_received, nodes_written, edges_written, write_failures, queue_depth, report_build_seconds).
- Backpressure + retry proven (kill writer mid-run; run still completes).
- One command to kick demo: `make e2e`.
DELIVERABLES:
- Infra manifests/job specs (Helm/K8s, Nomad HCL, or Compose+Temporal).
- Queue setup (NATS JetStream | Redis Streams | Temporal workflows).
- Updated service configs (envs, health checks).
- Make targets: seed, stage-scan, writer-replay/backfill, e2e, demo.
- Short runbook (deploy, operate, rollback).
~~~

---

## Minimal checklist (applies to any option)

- Control-plane up (Argo/Nomad/Temporal) with UI reachable.
- Durable queue/workflow configured; DLQ visible and drainable.
- Writer idempotency verified (keys/merge).
- Health checks enforced; start order gated.
- Metrics wired; dashboard imported; non-zero during run.
- Backfill path working from **staging** without re-ingest.
- Demo script rehearsed; `make e2e` green.

Tell me which option you want; I’ll deliver the concrete files and adapt ports/names to your repo immediately.

### Assistant

Got it — all-local. Below are two battle-tested, fully local orchestration choices that keep **Python + Memgraph** and run entirely on your laptop/desktop. Pick Option 1 for the fastest path; Option 2 if you want local K8s parity.

I’m giving you: (A) a precise prompt you can hand to a coding agent, (B) a compact checklist, and (C) ready-to-drop Compose/K8s snippets + minimal Python workflow code so you can execute today.

# ================================================================
OPTION 1 — Docker Compose++ with Temporal (durable local workflows)

Why: zero cloud deps, first-class retries/backoff/idempotency/backfill baked in, easiest to pilot in hours.

Deliverables (agent prompt)

- Single `docker/compose/docker-compose.local.yml` that brings up:
  - temporal (server + web + postgres), memgraph, prometheus, grafana, redis (optional), query, reporting, writer, workers
- Python workflow + activities for `ProcessRepo(run_id, repo)`
- Backfill workflow `BackfillSince(since_ts, ontology_ver)`
- Health-gated startup, deterministic Make targets, smoke tests

Prompt for coding agent (paste as-is)

```mermaid
python
TASK: Orchestrate the Fresh Platform locally via Docker Compose + Temporal, keeping Python + Memgraph. Implement a minimal but durable e2e
with
retries/backoff
and
a backfill flow. No managed services.

GOALS
- `make e2e` runs end-to-end on
2
repos
and
produces
500
nodes/
2000
edges combined; re-run writer drain
0
new edges.
- `make demo` opens Grafana + prints reports location.
- Kill/restart writer mid-run → workflow retries
and
completes.
- Backfill reprocesses staged batches without re-ingest.

1
) Compose file (docker/compose/docker-compose.local.yml)
Include services: temporal-postgres, temporal, temporal-admin-tools, temporal-web, memgraph, prometheus, grafana, fp-app-query, fp-app-reporting, fp-app-writer, fp-worker (Temporal worker running miners/analyzers/writer activities), fp-shared-package (initializes shared volume).

Key excerpts:
- temporal (server) configured
for
default namespace creation
- memgraph exposed on
7687
/
7444
, health check via bolt_check.py
- grafana & prometheus pre-provisioned (bundled dashboards)
- volumes: fp-shared, shared_repositories, memgraph-data, prometheus-data, grafana-data
- depends_on: condition: service_healthy to gate app startup

2
) Python workflows/activities
Structure under `orchestration/temporal_py/`:

- `workflows.py`
- `ProcessRepo`: activities `run_ingestion`, `run_miners`, `run_analyzers`, `writer_drain`
- Retries: exponential backoff; idempotency ensured by writer keys
- `backfill.py`
- `BackfillSince`: enumerates staged batches since TS

) Temporal worker (fp-worker)
Entrypoint runs Temporal worker hosting these activities + registering workflows on namespace `fresh`.
- env: TEMPORAL_ADDRESS=temporal:
7233
, NAMESPACE=fresh
- `python -m orchestration.temporal_py.worker`

4
) Make targets
- `make up` → `docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.local.yml up -d`
- `make seed` → apply ontology migrations into Memgraph
- `make e2e` → kicks two `ProcessRepo` workflows (hello-world GitHub +
1
GitLab)
- `make backfill` → runs `BackfillSince --since <ts> --ontology v0
.2
`
- `make demo` → prints report
dir
, opens Grafana/Temporal Web
- `make down` → stop
and
clean

5
) Monitoring (local)
- Prom metrics exposed by writer, staging, reporting; Grafana dashboard JSON preloaded.
- Key KPIs: events_received_total, nodes_written_total, edges_written_total, write_failures_total, queue_depth_gauge (
if
using Redis), report_build_seconds.

6
) Acceptance tests (scripted)
- Run `make e2e`, then call a second writer drain
for
same run_id; graph counts unchanged.
- Kill writer container mid-flow; Temporal retries; workflow completes.
- Query p95 < 200ms (local)
for
the
3
saved queries.
- Reports exist under `/reports/{repo}/{ts}`
with
Mermaid + PNG.

AC (merge gate)
- `make e2e` green end-to-end on a clean machine.
- Re-run drain yields
0
diff.
- `make backfill` recomputes subset without re-ingest.

Never-again guards
- Preflight: worker starts only after memgraph + shared are healthy.
- CI: run `temporal admin namespace describe fresh`; smoke execute a workflow; fail
if

not
completed.

Checklist (Option 1)

- Build/update images: shared, worker, writer, query, reporting
- `docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.local.yml up -d`
- `temporal` namespace “fresh” exists; web at [http://localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088/)
- `make seed` applies ontology migrations (idempotent)
- `make e2e` schedules two `ProcessRepo` workflows; verify Memgraph counts
- Kill `fp-app-writer` mid-run; confirm workflow retries & completes
- `make backfill -- SINCE=<ts> --ONTOLOGY=v0.2` recomputes without re-ingest
- Grafana at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) shows KPIs moving
- Second drain on same run_id yields 0 new nodes/edges

# ================================================================
OPTION 2 — k3d (local K8s) + Argo Workflows + NATS JetStream

Why: keep everything local but get real K8s DAGs & autoscaling semantics. Use `k3d` for a single-command local cluster.

Pilot shape

- `k3d cluster create fresh --api-port 6550 -p "80:80@loadbalancer" -p "7444:7444@server:0" -p "7687:7687@server:0"`
- Install with Helm (local charts in `infra/helm`):
  - nats jetstream, memgraph statefulset (PVC), prometheus, grafana, argo-workflows + argo-server
- Submit `e2e` workflow (ingest → miners → analyzers → writer drain)
- Expose query/reporting via ingress
- KEDA scales writer on NATS lag

K8s manifests (see prior message for snippets). All endpoints exposed on localhost via k3d load balancer.

Checklist (Option 2)

- `k3d cluster create` up; `kubectl get nodes` ok
- Helm installs successful; pods ready
- `argo submit e2e.yaml -p repo=... -p run_id=... --watch` completes
- Memgraph reachable at localhost:7687/7444
- Grafana shows KPIs; NATS stream depth visible
- Re-running writer step produces 0 new nodes/edges

———————————————

Which route do you want? If you choose **Option 1 (Compose+Temporal)** I’ll convert this into exact files (Compose YAML, worker scaffolds, Make targets) tailored to your repo naming and ports so you can run it locally today.

### Assistant

The **a2** repository orchestrates its services with Docker Compose V2.  The documentation (`docs/DOCKER_COMPOSE_V2.md`) shows that each service follows a naming convention (`fp‑{category}‑{service}`) and belongs to a phase (P1–P9) in the data‑flow.  Services are grouped into **profiles**—`infra` (Redis, Memgraph, Consul), `apps` (ingestion, mining, analysis, graph‑writer, query, reporting) and `monitor` (Prometheus, Grafana)—so operators can start only the required parts with `docker compose --profile <profile> up -d`.  Health checks are mandatory; each service exposes `/health` and `/metrics` endpoints.  Dependencies are declared using `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy`, ensuring that components (e.g., the graph‑writer) only start once their back‑ends (Memgraph, Redis and the shared package init job) are ready[github.com](https://github.com/casper-aurai/a2/blob/fb227ac6b96aecf03b77b5c7ffc37e2ad819d8b9/docs/DOCKER_COMPOSE_V2.md#L147-L185).  Prometheus is configured to scrape these metrics, while resource limits, networks (`fp-net`) and named volumes (e.g., `fp-shared`, `memgraph-data`) are defined centrally[github.com](https://github.com/casper-aurai/a2/blob/fb227ac6b96aecf03b77b5c7ffc37e2ad819d8b9/docs/DOCKER_COMPOSE_V2.md#L9-L16).  Version matrices show that every service is built against Python 3.12.6 and pinned image digests[github.com](https://github.com/casper-aurai/a2/blob/fb227ac6b96aecf03b77b5c7ffc37e2ad819d8b9/docs/versions.md#L14-L37).

### Gaps in the current setup

- **No automated rebuild/update** – The pipeline relies on manual `docker compose build` or `docker compose up` commands when code changes.  Containers built from local source code are only updated when a developer explicitly rebuilds them or restarts the service.  In production, the compose file uses pre‑built images; these images are only refreshed when someone pulls the latest tag and redeploys.
- **CI/CD limited to pre‑commit hooks** – The repo enforces consistent Python versions and linting via pre‑commit, but there is no pipeline to build, test and push images automatically.  Consequently, updating a running deployment requires manual steps: build images, push them to a registry and run `docker compose up` again.

### Tools to automate container updates

1. **Compose Watch for local development** – Docker Compose supports a `watch` attribute that automatically updates running services when files change.  When Compose is run with the `--watch` flag, any change matching watch rules triggers one of three actions:

• **sync** – mirrors changed files into the container (useful for hot‑reload frameworks)[docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/file-watch/#:~:text=);

• **rebuild** – automatically builds a new image with BuildKit and replaces the running container (behaves like `docker compose up --build`)[docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/file-watch/#:~:text=);

• **sync+restart** – syncs files and restarts the service without rebuilding[docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/file-watch/#:~:text=If%20,service%20containers%20and%20restarts%20them).

Compose Watch is ideal for development because it provides a hands‑off workflow—developers just edit and save code and Compose rebuilds or synchronizes the service automatically[docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/file-watch/#:~:text=The%20,when%20you%20save%20your%20work).  You could extend your `docker-compose.yml` with an `x-develop` section specifying watch rules for each service; for example, automatically rebuild the `analysis` container when Python files under `analysis_service/src` change.
2. **Watchtower for production image updates** – Watchtower is an open‑source utility that monitors the image tags of running containers and automatically updates them when newer images are available.  It runs as a Docker container and, on detecting a new image, will: pull the updated image, gracefully stop the existing container, start a new container with the same parameters and optionally remove the old one[betterstack.com](https://betterstack.com/community/guides/scaling-docker/watchtower-docker/#:~:text=Understanding%20Watchtower%27s%20functionality).  Watchtower can be added as a service to your `docker-compose.yml`:
3. **Continuous integration pipeline** – Setting up GitHub Actions (or GitLab CI) to build, test and push container images on every commit gives you reproducible, up‑to‑date images.  A typical workflow would:
  - Run linters, type checks and unit tests.
  - Build container images using the pinned Python version and push them to a registry (e.g., GitHub Container Registry).
  - Tag images semantically (e.g., `fp-app-analysis:sha-<short>`).

  When combined with Watchtower, new images will be pulled into the running deployment automatically.  For local development, Compose Watch ensures that changes are reflected instantly without needing to push images.
4. **Tilt (optional for local dev)** – Tools like Tilt automate the inner‑loop development workflow for multi‑service apps.  Tilt watches your source files and performs in‑place updates of containers (synchronizing files or rerunning commands) so you don’t have to rebuild images or restart services.  Tilt’s **Live Update** feature can copy changed files into a container and run commands like `pip install` on dependency changes[docs.tilt.dev](https://docs.tilt.dev/tutorial/5-live-update.html#:~:text=Even%20with%20Docker%20layer%20caching%2C,development%2C%20every%20code%20change%20requires)[docs.tilt.dev](https://docs.tilt.dev/tutorial/5-live-update.html#:~:text=sync%28%27,api%2Frequirements.txt%27%5D%20%29%20%5D).  While Tilt is typically used with Kubernetes, it can work with Docker Compose via a `Tiltfile`.  This offers more flexibility than Compose Watch—for example, running `pytest` after syncing code or installing dependencies selectively.

### Recommendations

- **Adopt Compose Watch for developer productivity** – Define `watch` rules in your compose file for services built from local code.  Use `sync` for interpreted code that supports hot reload and `rebuild` for compiled artifacts or when changes affect dependencies.  Run development stacks with `docker compose up --watch` so containers update automatically when code changes.
- **Integrate Watchtower for production** – Add a Watchtower service to your Compose file.  Configure it with a reasonable interval (e.g., 30 minutes) and restrict it to monitor only containers that should auto‑update.  Set `WATCHTOWER_CLEANUP=true` to remove old images and `WATCHTOWER_LABEL_ENABLE=true` if you prefer opt‑in updates via labels.  Combine this with a CI pipeline that pushes images whenever code is merged.
- **Implement a CI pipeline** – Use GitHub Actions to build and test each service image, push it to a registry and update tags.  Incorporate version checks (like the existing `versions.md`) to ensure all services stay on the same Python baseline.
- **Explore advanced dev loops** – If your team frequently iterates on the graph or analysis logic, evaluate Tilt or similar tools for more sophisticated live updating (e.g., running migrations or installing dependencies on the fly).  For now, Compose Watch provides a simpler built‑in solution.

By combining these tools, the a2 platform would achieve continuous delivery: code changes would trigger image builds, images would be automatically pulled into running deployments, and developers could work in a live‑update environment without manual container restarts.

### Assistant

I’ve scaffolded a complete proof‑of‑concept pipeline using an entirely new, all‑open‑source stack.  Everything runs locally on your MacBook (M3 Pro) and uses **no external services**.  The stack uses **Go microservices** for each pipeline stage, **NATS JetStream** as a lightweight message bus, **Dgraph** as the graph database, **Prometheus/Grafana** for monitoring, and the standard **docker compose** CLI (so Docker Desktop is no longer required; you can run it with Colima or Podman).

### Key elements

- **Ingestion (`cmd/ingestion`)** – publishes dummy file events to JetStream every 10 seconds; exposes `/health` and `/metrics`.
- **Miner (`cmd/miner`)** – listens on `ingestion.events`, computes a file “size” and publishes a new event.
- **Analyzer (`cmd/analyzer`)** – listens on `miner.events`, computes a fake “complexity” metric, and publishes to `analysis.events`.
- **Writer (`cmd/writer`)** – connects to Dgraph via gRPC, creates a simple schema, and writes each analysis event into the graph as a vertex; exposes metrics and health.
- **Query API (`cmd/query`)** – a small REST API built with `chi` that queries Dgraph and returns JSON (`/files?limit=N`, `/stats`).
- **Reporting (`cmd/report`)** – periodically calls the Query API, writes a Markdown report with a simple table of files into a `reports/` folder, and exposes metrics.
- **Message Bus** – uses the official `nats` image with JetStream enabled; each stage has its own stream.
- **Graph DB** – uses the `dgraph/standalone` image; persists data in a Docker volume and exposes both gRPC (9080) and HTTP (8080).
- **Monitoring** – Prometheus scrapes all services’ `/metrics` endpoints as defined in `freshpoc/prometheus.yml`; Grafana (admin/admin) is preconfigured to read from Prometheus.

### Orchestration

A single `freshpoc/docker-compose.yml` defines all services with health‑checks and proper `depends_on` conditions, ensuring start‑up order.  Health and metrics endpoints follow the patterns recommended in the Fresh Platform V2 docs[github.com](https://github.com/casper-aurai/a2/blob/fb227ac6b96aecf03b77b5c7ffc37e2ad819d8b9/docs/DOCKER_COMPOSE_V2.md#L147-L185).  You can build and run everything via the provided `Makefile`:

~~~ bash
cd freshpoc
make up       # builds and starts all services (NATS, Dgraph, services, Prometheus, Grafana)
make logs     # tail logs for all services
make down     # stops containers
make clean    # stops and removes volumes
~~~

When the stack is up, you can visit:

- **Dgraph UI:** `http://localhost:8080/` to inspect the graph database.
- **Query API:** `http://localhost:8005/files` to list stored file nodes.
- **Prometheus:** `http://localhost:9090/` to view raw metrics.
- **Grafana:** `http://localhost:3000/` (admin/admin) for dashboards.
- **Reports:** the `freshpoc/reports/` folder on your host will contain timestamped Markdown reports.

### Extending

This is a minimal pipeline; you can now:

- Replace the dummy ingestion logic with real Git cloning and file discovery.
- Extend miners/analyzers to parse Python or SQL files.
- Enrich the writer to create meaningful relationships between nodes.
- Use Dgraph’s GraphQL endpoint to expose more complex queries.
- Customize the Prometheus/Grafana dashboards for deeper observability.
- Add live‑code reloading for development using Docker Compose’s `watch` feature, which automatically rebuilds services on file changes[docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/file-watch/#:~:text=The%20,when%20you%20save%20your%20work), and consider tools like Watchtower for seamless image updates in production[betterstack.com](https://betterstack.com/community/guides/scaling-docker/watchtower-docker/#:~:text=Understanding%20Watchtower%27s%20functionality).

This scaffolding provides a realistic production‑style deployment that you can build upon while experimenting with alternative technologies.

### Assistant

Here’s a compact option map for your all-local, all-OSS POC. I’ve kept tables terse (keywords only) and added short notes below each where trade-offs matter.

## Container engine & compose

| Area | Current | Alternatives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime | Docker CLI (with Colima) | Podman, nerdctl+containerd, Lima/Finch |
| Compose | docker compose v2 | podman-compose, nerdctl compose, Tilt (dev loop) |
| Local registry | none | registry:2, Harbor (single-node), Quay |

Notes: Podman works rootless; nerdctl aligns with containerd; Harbor adds UI, signing, vuln scan (heavier).

## Orchestration / workflows

| Area | Current | Alternatives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Process orchestration | Make + Compose | Temporal OSS, Nomad, Dagster OSS, Prefect OSS |
| DAG on k8s (local) | — | k3d+k8s + Argo Workflows, kind+k8s |
| Job queue | NATS JetStream | Redis Streams, RabbitMQ, Redpanda/Kafka, Apache Kafka (KRaft) |

Notes: Temporal = durable workflows/retries; Nomad = light scheduler; Argo needs local k8s (k3d/kind).

## Messaging & streaming

| Area | Current | Alternatives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bus | NATS JetStream | RabbitMQ, Redis Streams, Redpanda, Kafka |
| Schema | JSON | Protobuf, Avro (+ Schema Registry), JSON Schema |

Notes: Redpanda is Kafka-compatible and lightweight; Redis Streams is simple for single-node.

## Graph database

| Area | Current | Alternatives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Graph store | Dgraph | Memgraph, Neo4j CE, ArangoDB, JanusGraph(+Scylla/Cassandra), NebulaGraph |

Notes: Memgraph = Cypher, great for path queries; Arango = multi-model; JanusGraph needs backing store.

## Staging & files

| Area | Current | Alternatives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Object store | Host volume | MinIO (S3-compatible), SeaweedFS, Local FS (bind) |
| Content index | none | SQLite/duckdb sidecar, Meilisearch, OpenSearch (heavy) |

Notes: MinIO gives versioned artifacts; duckdb excels for local analytics.

## Services (ingest/miner/analyzer/writer)

| Area | Current | Alternatives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language | Go | Python (FastAPI), Rust (axum), Node/TS (Fastify) |
| API framework | net/http + chi | FastAPI, aiohttp, axum, Fastify, Gin |
| Concurrency | goroutines | asyncio, tokio, worker threads |

Notes: Keep one language for speed; Python helps with AST/SQL parsing; Rust for perf.

## Query layer

| Area | Current | Alternatives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API | REST (chi) | GraphQL (gqlgen), OpenAPI (oapi-codegen), gRPC |
| Query cache | none | Redis, in-proc LRU, ristretto |
| Saved queries | code | file-based templates, gql persisted ops |

Notes: gqlgen gives typed GraphQL fast; Redis speeds hot paths.

## Reporting & docs

| Area | Current | Alternatives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Site gen | Markdown files | Docusaurus, MkDocs, Hugo, mdBook, Sphinx |
| Diagrams | Mermaid (MD) | PlantUML, Graphviz, ElkJS (export), Cytoscape (export) |
| PDF export | none | WeasyPrint, Pandoc, Puppeteer/Playwright |

Notes: Hugo/mdBook are fast and simple; Docusaurus good for dev portals.

## Observability

| Area | Current | Alternatives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Metrics | Prometheus | VictoriaMetrics, Prometheus + Thanos (heavy) |
| Dashboards | Grafana | Chronograf (Influx), Netdata (local) |
| Logs | container logs | Loki, vector/Fluent Bit, elasticsearch (heavy) |
| Tracing | none | Jaeger, Tempo + OTEL Collector |

Notes: Start with Prometheus+Grafana; add Loki later for correlated logs; OTEL unifies signals.

## Security, config, secrets

| Area | Current | Alternatives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Secrets | env files | Doppler OSS CLI (local), sops-age, 1Password-SCIM (not offline), HashiCorp Vault dev |
| Config | env + flags | koanf/viper (Go), pydantic-settings (Py), dotenvx |
| Image supply chain | none | cosign (local key), syft+grype, Trivy |

Notes: For fully offline, sops-age fits well; cosign enables local signing.

## Testing & dev-loop

| Area | Current | Alternatives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit tests | go test | pytest (Py), cargo test (Rust), vitest/jest (TS) |
| API tests | Postman | newman CLI, k6 (HTTP), schemathesis (OpenAPI) |
| Dev loop | manual rebuilds | docker compose **watch**, Tilt, Air/Reflex (Go), nodemon (TS) |

Notes: Compose **watch** gives rebuild/sync on file changes; Tilt adds live-update logic.

## Build & packaging

| Area | Current | Alternatives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Build tool | Make | taskfile.dev, Bazel, Pants, Nix |
| Images | multi-stage | ko (Go), BuildKit bake, buildx, pack (CNB) |
| Artifacts | none | Gitea CI (local), Woodpecker CI, Jenkins (local) |

Notes: BuildKit bake centralizes multi-image builds; Woodpecker is a light local CI.

## Parsers & analyzers (code IQ)

| Area | Current | Alternatives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python AST | custom | tree-sitter-python, libCST, jedi |
| SQL | custom | SQLGlot, sqruff, sqlparse, tree-sitter-sql |
| Git intel | custom | libgit2, dulwich, gitoxide (Rust), go-git |

Notes: SQLGlot is robust across dialects; tree-sitter gives uniform parsing.

### Suggested “mix-n-match” stacks (all local, OSS)

**Minimal & fast (Compose-first):**

- Compose v2, docker compose **watch**
- NATS JetStream, Memgraph
- Go services (chi), Prometheus+Grafana, Loki later
- MinIO for artifacts, sops-age for secrets

**Durable workflows (no k8s):**

- Temporal OSS (+ OTEL), Redis Streams
- Memgraph or ArangoDB
- Python services (FastAPI) for AST/SQL, Go for writer
- Prometheus+Grafana+Jaeger

**K8s parity (still local):**

- k3d, Argo Workflows, NATS JetStream
- Memgraph StatefulSet
- Dagster for data jobs, Prom/Grafana/Loki/Tempo
- Harbor as local registry

If you pick a direction, I’ll translate this into concrete files (compose or k3d manifests, Make targets, sample config) and wire a dev loop (Compose **watch** or Tilt) so edits rebuild/restart hands-free.

### Assistant

Locked: **Memgraph stays.** I’ll swap the scaffold from Dgraph → Memgraph and keep everything 100% local & OSS. Below you get: (1) the minimal **delta plan**, (2) ready-to-paste code for **writer** (Cypher MERGE) and **query** (Cypher READ), (3) the **Compose** service for Memgraph with health checks, and (4) a short **checklist & AC**. Finally, I keep the alternatives table for every other layer—but with Memgraph fixed.

# 1) Migration delta (Dgraph ➜ Memgraph)

- Remove Dgraph service & client code.
- Add Memgraph service (`memgraph/memgraph:latest`), expose **7687 (Bolt)** and **7444 (HTTP)**.
- Use the **Neo4j Go driver v5** (Bolt) against Memgraph.
- Bootstrap schema (indexes) at writer start:
  - `CREATE INDEX file_path IF NOT EXISTS FOR (f:File) ON (f.path);`
- Writer consumes `analysis.events` ➜ Cypher upserts:
  - `MERGE (f:File {path:$path}) SET f.size=$size, f.complexity=$complexity, f.updatedAt=datetime()`
- Query API runs Cypher reads:
  - `MATCH (f:File) RETURN f.path AS path, f.size AS size, f.complexity AS complexity ORDER BY f.updatedAt DESC LIMIT $n`
- Health: bolt check query `RETURN 1` on `/health`.
- Metrics: unchanged Prometheus endpoints (ports stay 8004 for writer, 8005 for query).
- Reporting service remains unchanged (calls Query API).

# 2) Writer (Go, Cypher MERGE, Memgraph via Bolt)

 query:
 # ...
 environment:

 depends_on:

~~~

> Local engine note: with **Colima** or **Podman**, `docker compose` works the same. If you fully uninstall Docker Desktop, spin up Colima (`colima start --cpu 4 --memory 8`) or use Podman with `podman-compose`.

# 5) Runbook (local, no cloud)

1. Replace Dgraph blocks in your compose with the **Memgraph** block above; remove Dgraph service.
2. Update `cmd/writer` and `cmd/query` with the code above; keep `ingestion/miner/analyzer` as-is.
3. `make up` (or `docker compose up --build -d`)
4. Verify:
  - `curl http://localhost:8004/health` (writer) → `ok`
  - `curl http://localhost:8005/files?limit=5` (query) → JSON list (after events flow through)
  - `open http://localhost:7444` (Memgraph HTTP UI)
  - Grafana `http://localhost:3000` (admin/admin)

### Acceptance criteria

- Pipeline flows end-to-end: ingestion ➜ miner ➜ analyzer ➜ **writer(Memgraph)**.
- Re-running the flow on same events does **not** create duplicates (MERGE idempotency).
- `/files` returns recent nodes with size/complexity fields.
- Prometheus scrapes writer & query; metrics increase during traffic.

---

# 6) Alternatives table (Memgraph fixed)

| Layer | Current | Alternatives (still Memgraph) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Container runtime | Docker CLI (+Colima) | Podman, nerdctl+containerd |
| Orchestration (local) | Compose v2 | Nomad (single node), Temporal OSS (durable workflows) |
| Messaging | NATS JetStream | Redis Streams (simple), Redpanda (Kafka-API), RabbitMQ |
| Graph DB | **Memgraph (required)** | — |
| Go driver to Memgraph | neo4j-go-driver v5 | NeoDash via HTTP for BI; mgconsole (admin) |
| API layer | Go + chi (REST) | GraphQL (gqlgen), gRPC |
| Dev loop | manual rebuild | docker compose **watch**, Tilt (live-update) |
| Secrets/config | env files | sops-age, dotenvx |
| Metrics | Prometheus | VictoriaMetrics (single-binary) |
| Dashboards | Grafana | Netdata (local), Grafana+Loki later |
| Logs | container logs | Loki + Promtail/Vector |
| Testing | go test + Postman | newman, k6 (HTTP), schemathesis (OpenAPI) |
| Artifact store | bind volume | MinIO (S3-compatible, local) |

---

If you want, I can generate a **single patch** that: removes Dgraph from the scaffold, drops in the writer/query code above, and updates the compose file. Say the word and I’ll deliver the diff so you can paste it straight in.

### Assistant

Love it—keeping Memgraph, and adding **Apache Airflow** + **Apache Kafka** with **Weaviate** (local, OSS, production-style). Below is a tight, agent-ready plan that upgrades the scaffold you have:

- Airflow orchestrates the end-to-end pipeline (ingest → mine → analyze → graph-write → report).
- Kafka replaces NATS (durable topics, replay, partitions).
- Weaviate stores vectors for search/semantics; Memgraph remains the source of truth for relationships.
- Everything runs locally in Compose; no external services.

---

# 1) Architecture deltas

- **Control plane:** Airflow (LocalExecutor) + Postgres metadata, one containerized webserver+scheduler.
- **Data plane:** Kafka (KRaft, single node) + Kafka UI (optional), Memgraph, Weaviate, services.
- **Services:** your Go services switch from NATS to Kafka clients (producer/consumer). Writer uses Memgraph Bolt (unchanged). A new sidecar “embedder” service can push vectors to Weaviate (or analyzers can do it inline).
- **Contracts:** events remain JSON with a versioned envelope; Kafka topics per stage; Weaviate schema per artifact type.

Event topics (single partition to start; scale later):

- `ingestion.events`, `miner.events`, `analysis.events`, `report.events` (+ optional `errors.dlq`)

---

# 2) Compose services (add/replace)

Add these to `docker-compose.yml` (keep your Memgraph service as is). Images are OSS and run offline (first run may pull images; no external SaaS).

# 4) Service changes (Go) — switch NATS → Kafka

**Producer** (ingestion → `ingestion.events`):

~~~ python
// common/kafka_producer.go
package common
import (
 "context"
 "github.com/segmentio/kafka-go"
 "time"
)
func NewWriter(broker, topic string) *kafka.Writer {
 return &kafka.Writer{
 Addr: kafka.TCP(broker),
 Topic: topic,
 Balancer: &kafka.LeastBytes{},
 RequiredAcks: kafka.RequireOne,
 BatchTimeout: 100 * time.Millisecond,
 }
}
func Publish(ctx context.Context, w *kafka.Writer, key, value []byte) error {
 return w.WriteMessages(ctx, kafka.Message{Key: key, Value: value})
}
~~~

**Consumer** (miner/analyzer/writer reading from topics):

~~~ python
// common/kafka_consumer.go
package common
import (
 "context"
 "github.com/segmentio/kafka-go"
)
func NewReader(broker, topic, group string) *kafka.Reader {
 return kafka.NewReader(kafka.ReaderConfig{
 Brokers: []string{broker},
 Topic: topic,
 GroupID: group,
 MinBytes: 1e3,
 MaxBytes: 10e6,
 })
}
func Consume(ctx context.Context, r *kafka.Reader, handle func(k, v []byte) error) error {
 defer r.Close()
 for {
 m, err := r.ReadMessage(ctx)
 if err != nil { return err }
 if err := handle(m.Key, m.Value); err != nil { /* log + DLQ later */ }
 }
}
~~~

**Topics to create on startup** (one-time; you can run a tiny init container or let services ensure them):

~~~ bash
kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --create --if-not-exists --topic ingestion.events --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1

# 5) Weaviate: schema & upsert vectors

Keep Weaviate modules disabled; you supply vectors from the analyzer (or a new `embedder` service). Minimal class:

~~~ python
{
 "class": "FileArtifact",
 "description": "Source file entity with vector",
 "vectorizer": "none",
 "properties": [
 {"name": "path", "dataType": ["text"], "description": "File path"},
 {"name": "repo", "dataType": ["text"]},
 {"name": "size", "dataType": ["int"]},
 {"name": "complexity", "dataType": ["int"]}
 ]
}
~~~

Create via:

~~~ bash
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8081/v1/schema" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d @schema-fileartifact.json
~~~

Insert (vector supplied inline as `vector`):

~~~ python
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8081/v1/objects" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{
 "class": "FileArtifact",
 "properties": {
 "path": "repo/a.py", "repo":"repo", "size": 1200, "complexity": 17
 },
 "vector": [0.01,0.13,...] # your analyzer embeds
 }'
~~~

Search (nearest neighbors):

~~~ bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8081/v1/graphql" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
"query": "{ Get { FileArtifact(nearVector: {vector:[0.01,0.13,...]}, limit: 5) { path size complexity } } }"
}'
~~~

> Where do vectors come from?
>
> Option A: analyzer computes embeddings (e.g., sentence-transformers) and publishes to `analysis.events`.
>
> Option B: dedicated `embedder` service subscribes to `analysis.events`, fetches content, computes vectors and writes to Weaviate.
>
> Both are fully local. If you want zero internet, pre-bundle a small HF model in your image layers.

# 6) Writer & Query unchanged on Memgraph

Keep the Memgraph code I gave earlier (Bolt + Neo4j driver, MERGE semantics). Your writer still consumes `analysis.events`—only the transport changes (Kafka reader vs NATS).

---

# 7) Airflow tasks: hand-off pattern

- `ingest` task: POST to `ingestion:/trigger` → service publishes to `ingestion.events`.
- `mine` task: POST to `miner:/trigger` → miners run consumers (or they’re always on; the task can be a no-op check).
- Same for `analyze`.
- `write_graph` calls `/drain` on writer (or writer is always on; the task checks Kafka lags).
- `render_reports` calls reporting endpoint.

> For more robust control, switch tasks to Kafka admin checks (topic lag) or to run one-off “batch consumers” launched by Airflow. Start simple with always-on services.

---

# 8) Make targets (extend)

~~~ make
topics:
\t@docker exec -it kafka bash -lc 'kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --create --if-not-exists --topic ingestion.events --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1'
\t@docker exec -it kafka bash -lc 'kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --create --if-not-exists --topic miner.events --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1'
\t@docker exec -it kafka bash -lc 'kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --create --if-not-exists --topic analysis.events --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1'
airflow-ui:
\t@open http://localhost:8080
kafka-ui:
\t@open http://localhost:8085
~~~

---

# 9) Observability quick wins

- Services already expose Prometheus metrics; add Kafka exporter later (optional).
- Add **Airflow metrics** (statsd/OTEL) in a follow-up.
- Add Weaviate `/v1/.well-known/ready` to Prom scrape if you want uptime graphs.

---

# 10) Acceptance criteria (48h PoC)

1. `make up && make topics` → all containers healthy; Airflow UI at `:8080`.
2. Trigger DAG `freshpoc_e2e`: files flow across Kafka topics; writer MERGEs into Memgraph.
3. `/files?limit=5` returns rows; re-run DAG produces **0 new nodes** (idempotent).
4. Analyzer (or embedder) sends vectors to Weaviate; top-k search returns expected nearest paths.
5. Prometheus/Grafana show non-zero traffic; Kafka UI shows topic lag drained after run.

---

If you want, I’ll produce a **single patch** that:

- Adds Airflow + Kafka + Weaviate to your compose,
- Swaps NATS calls to `kafka-go` in services,
- Drops in the Airflow DAG, Weaviate schema, and Make targets.

### Assistant

Great—here’s a crisp summary + big-picture visualization of the **all-local OSS** stack with your preferences (**Dgraph** graph store, **Docusaurus** for docs). I’ve also mapped your **temporal requirements** (retries, backfills, SLAs, human-in-the-loop) to concrete components, and sketched how we’ll test against **dbt-labs/jaffle-shop-classic**.

# Stack at a glance (current proposal)

- **Runtime & packaging:** Docker CLI (via Colima or Podman), Compose v2, BuildKit multi-stage images.
- **Orchestration:** Airflow (LocalExecutor) **or** Temporal OSS (choose one; see “Temporal coverage”).
- **Messaging:** Apache Kafka (KRaft, single-node), topics per stage.
- **Graph store:** **Dgraph** (single container, local volume).
- **Semantic search (optional):** Weaviate (vectorizer disabled; we supply vectors).
- **Services:** Ingestion → Miner(s) → Analyzer(s) → Graph-Writer → Query API → Reporting.
- **Docs:** **Docusaurus** site (pulls data from Query API at build time; emits MDX + Mermaid).
- **Observability:** Prometheus + Grafana (Loki later), health/metrics on each service.
- **Artifacts:** Local volume + optional MinIO for versioned staging outputs (JSONL, images, reports).

# Temporal requirements — coverage map

| Requirement | Airflow (LocalExecutor) | Temporal OSS (workflows) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Retries/backoff | Per-task retries, exponential backoff | Built-in retry policy (activity/workflow) |
| Backfill/historical runs | Backfill by date or manual DAG run | Launch backfill workflow with parameters |
| Idempotency guarantees | Implement in tasks/services (e.g., upsert keys) | Strong with workflow IDs + deterministic logic |
| Human-in-the-loop | Manual task, sensors, approvals | Signals/queries to pause/resume workflows |
| SLAs/alerts | SLAs per task, email/webhook | Cron schedules, timeouts, heartbeats |
| Observability | Airflow UI + logs; add Prom exporter | Web UI + workflow history; OTEL exporter |
| Local footprint | 1× Postgres + 1× Airflow | Temporal server + Postgres/SQLite (dev) |

**Recommendation:**

- If you value **Apache lineage & DAG UX**, start with **Airflow**.
- If you need **durable stateful orchestration** (exactly-once patterns, backfills without re-ingest, human-in-the-loop via signals), prefer **Temporal**.

Either way, your **idempotent graph-writer** and **Kafka topic replay** cover correctness.

# Dgraph + Docusaurus specifics

- **Dgraph**
  - Use **GraphQL+** mutations for upserts: deterministic UIDs via composite keys (e.g., `repo|path`).
  - Bootstrap schema: types (`File`, `Model`, `DependsOn` edges); add upsert blocks with `@upsert` to avoid dupes.
  - Expose both gRPC (9080) and HTTP (8080); writer uses gRPC (dgo), query API can use HTTP for simplicity.
- **Docusaurus**
  - Keep the site local (`npm ci && npm run build && npm run serve`).
  - Add a prebuild step that **fetches from Query API** and emits `docs/generated/*.mdx` + Mermaid code blocks (e.g., dbt model dependency graph).
  - Centralize Mermaid theming once; keep diagrams as fenced blocks embedded in MDX.

# Using
dbt-labs/jaffle-shop-classic
as target

**Scope:** SQL models + dbt project metadata → lineage + simple metrics.

**Plan:**

1. **Ingestion**: clone the repo (shallow), enumerate `models/**/*.sql`, parse dbt `schema.yml`.
2. **Miner(s)**: detect model names, refs, sources; extract `ref()` and `source()` to produce preliminary edges.
3. **Analyzer(s)**:
  - Build **logical lineage** graph across bronze/silver/gold layers.
  - Emit metrics per model: in-degree, out-degree, level (topological rank).
4. **Writer (Dgraph)**:
  - `File` (path, repo), `Model` (name, layer), edges: `DEPENDS_ON`, `PRODUCES`.
  - Idempotent upserts keyed on `{repo,path}` & `{repo,model}`.
5. **Query API**:
  - `/models?layer=gold`, `/lineage?model=orders`, `/hotspots?top=10`.
6. **Reporting + Docusaurus**:
  - Tables for models per layer.
  - Mermaid **flowchart** for lineage of a chosen model.
  - Change-summary page (diff between two runs).

# Optional additions (low friction, all local)

- **MinIO** for versioned staging artifacts (events JSONL, rendered PNGs).
- **DuckDB** for quick profiling/QA of miner/analyzer outputs.
- **Kafka UI** (provectus) to inspect topics and lags.
- **Loki** later for logs; start with container logs + `docker compose logs -f`.

# Immediate decisions to lock

1. **Orchestration:** pick **Airflow** *or* **Temporal**.
2. **Vectors:** include **Weaviate** now or defer (we can add later without touching Dgraph path).
3. **Dev loop:** enable `docker compose watch` for services that benefit from live rebuilds.

If you confirm Airflow vs Temporal, I’ll generate the concrete scaffolding deltas (Compose services, minimal DAG or workflows, service stubs for Dgraph/Docusaurus prebuild) and a tiny **jaffle-shop** parser so we can run the first end-to-end demo today.

### Assistant

Perfect. Locking these stack choices:

- Container runtime: **Podman** (+ Buildah, Skopeo, podman-compose)
- Orchestration: **Apache Airflow** (LocalExecutor)
- Messaging: **Apache Kafka (KRaft single-node)**
- Graph DB: **Dgraph**
- Vector DB: **Weaviate** (modules disabled; we push vectors)
- Object store: **MinIO**
- Observability: **Prometheus + Grafana + Loki + Promtail**
- Docs: **Docusaurus**
- Test repo: **dbt-labs/jaffle-shop-classic**

Below is the Podman-first scaffolding plan, diagrams, and ready-to-drop service configs. If you want, I’ll turn this into a single PR-style patch next.

# Podman-first ops (Mac, no Docker Desktop)

- Install: `brew install podman podman-compose buildah skopeo`
- Init VM: `podman machine init --cpus 6 --memory 12288` (first time)
- Start VM: `podman machine start`
- Compose up: `podman-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d`

(Same Compose file; we’ll avoid Docker-only features.)
- Images: build with **Buildah** inside Dockerfiles or simply rely on `podman-compose build`.

# Compose services (additions & updates)

# Minimal acceptance criteria (PoC)

- **Local only**: All containers healthy under Podman (`podman ps` shows running).
- **Flow**: Trigger Airflow DAG → events traverse Kafka → writer upserts into **Dgraph**; `/files?limit=5` returns data.
- **Idempotency**: Re-run DAG; **no duplicate** nodes/edges (use upsert keys in writer).
- **Vectors**: Embedder sends vectors to **Weaviate**; `nearVector` query returns top-k.
- **Artifacts**: MinIO contains staged JSONL & reports; public download enabled for `reports/`.
- **Observability**: Prometheus targets up; Grafana shows metrics; logs visible in Loki.

# Next actions (I can prep immediately)

1. Generate a single **compose** file with the blocks above integrated.
2. Add **monitoring/** configs (Prometheus scrape jobs for each service; the Loki/Promtail files).
3. Add **Airflow DAG** + tiny HTTP endpoints in services (`/trigger`, `/drain`, `/generate`).
4. Create **Weaviate schema** and **Kafka topics** init jobs.
5. Add a small **jaffle-shop** parser in the miner/analyzer.

Tell me if you want Airflow wired in first (recommended, you prefer Apache) or if you also want a Temporal variant side-by-side for comparison.
